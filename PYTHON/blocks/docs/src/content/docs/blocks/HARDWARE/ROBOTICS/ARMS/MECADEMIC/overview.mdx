This node's output can be fed into a move keyframes node to create a movement along a circular path of a given radius and center point. This is not an opertaion on the robot, just generating keyframes.. It can feed into a move keyframes node to define a move for a Mecademic arm. Blending is recommended for a smooth circular move."}, {'link': '/blocks/hardware/robotics/arms/mecademic/connect', 'name': 'CONNECT', 'description': 'The CONNECT node establishes a connection to the Mecademic robot arm via HTTP and activates the robot arm. The IP Address to use is the same one that is used to access the Mecademic web interface. Example: 192.168.0.100'}, {'link': '/blocks/hardware/robotics/arms/mecademic/delay', 'name': 'DELAY', 'description': 'Delay the action between two blocks.'}, {'link': '/blocks/hardware/robotics/arms/mecademic/disconnect', 'name': 'DISCONNECT', 'description': 'DISCONNECT disconnects the Mecademic robot arm via its API. This is required if the arm is to be used without rebooting.'}, {'link': '/blocks/hardware/robotics/arms/mecademic/home', 'name': 'HOME', 'description': 'Home the robot arm. This block is required to be run before any other robot arm movement. It is recommended to run this block immediately after "ACTIVATE". The robot is expected to move a little bit during the running of this node.'}, {'link': '/blocks/hardware/robotics/arms/mecademic/move-circle', 'name': 'MOVE_CIRCLE', 'description': "MOVE CIRCLE is an action node that moves the mecademic robot along a circular path defined by a center point about its current position.. It is equivalent to the combination of generating circle keyframes at the robot's current position and then running move keyframes. This node is useful for executing circular moves in tool relative space. A high blending value is recommended for a smooth circular move."}, {'link': '/blocks/hardware/robotics/arms/mecademic/move-joint', 'name': 'MOVE_JOINT', 'description': "Linearly move the robot's tool to an absolute Cartesian position."}, {'link': '/blocks/hardware/robotics/arms/mecademic/move-keyframes', 'name': 'MOVE_KEYFRAMES', 'description': "The MOVE_KEYFRAMES node linearly moves the robot's tool according to a set of 3d animation style keyframes."}, {'link': '/blocks/hardware/robotics/arms/mecademic/move-keyframes-lin', 'name': 'MOVE_KEYFRAMES_LIN', 'description': "The MOVE_KEYFRAMES node LINEARLY RELATIVE TO A REFERENCE FRAME moves the robot's tool according to a set of 3d animation style keyframes."}, {'link': '/blocks/hardware/robotics/arms/mecademic/move-lin', 'name': 'MOVE_LIN', 'description': "Linearly move the robot's tool to an absolute Cartesian position."}, {'link': '/blocks/hardware/robotics/arms/mecademic/move-lin-rel-trf', 'name': 'MOVE_LIN_REL_TRF', 'description': "The MOVE_LIN node linearly moves the robot's tool to an absolute Cartesian position relative to the robot's tool reference frame which is set by the SET_TRF node."}, {'link': '/blocks/hardware/robotics/arms/mecademic/move-pose', 'name': 'MOVE_POSE', 'description': 'Move the robot to a specified pose in space.'}, {'link': '/blocks/hardware/robotics/arms/mecademic/set-blending', 'name': 'SET_BLENDING', 'description': 'The SET_BLENDING to make the moves of the robot arm smoother.'}, {'link': '/blocks/hardware/robotics/arms/mecademic/set-cart-lin-vel', 'name': 'SET_CART_LIN_VEL', 'description': "Set the robot arm's linear velocity in Cartesian coordinates."}, {'link': '/blocks/hardware/robotics/arms/mecademic/set-joint-vel', 'name': 'SET_JOINT_VEL', 'description': "The SET_JOINT_VEL node sets the robot arm's angular velocity for its joints."}, {'link': '/blocks/hardware/robotics/arms/mecademic/set-trf', 'name': 'SET_TRF', 'description': " The SET_TRF node sets the robot arm's reference frame."}]} />
