Apps in Flojoy Studio are comprised of Blocks - which are simply Python scripts under-the-hood.

Connect Flojoy Blocks together in the Flojoy Studio canvas with drag-and-drop.
It takes only a few nodes to build powerful DAQ, robotics, data science, or AI apps.
Flojoy is the easiets, fastest way for no-code or low-code engineers such as
mechanical engineers, chemical engineers, aerospace engineers, fluidics engineers,
or applied biologists to build powerful, Python-based data pipelines without coding.

On this docs page, you will find all blocks that are available out-of-the-box in Flojoy Studio.
If you're a proficient Python developer, you can also build your own, custom blocks
by [following this guide](/contribution/blocks/custom-flojoy-block/). You can also [contact us](https://www.flojoy.ai/professional-services).

All of the blocks that you can find on the left sidebar are free to use,
open-source (MIT licensed), and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/flojoy-ai/blocks/).
