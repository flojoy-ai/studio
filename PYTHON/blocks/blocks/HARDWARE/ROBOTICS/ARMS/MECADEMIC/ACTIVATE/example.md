In this example, the `ACTIVATE` node is responsible for activating the MECADEMIC MECA500 robot arm. 

The node takes in the IP address of the robot arm and an optional parameter to specify if the simulator should be activated instead of the actual robot arm. 

After activation, the node returns the same IP address as an acknowledgment that the robot arm is now active.

The `ACTIVATE` node is often the first node in a flow, ensuring that the robot arm is ready for subsequent operations.
