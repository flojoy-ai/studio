# Blocks

Welcome to Flojoy's standard Blocks library.

## Contribution

You can find the contribution guide over at [here](https://blocks.flojoy.ai/contribution/docs/blocks-section/)

Note that we will no longer be using the `main` + `develop` branching combo
like we did before. All PRs should be made to the `main` branch from now on.
For releases, we will use the git's tags feature instead of relying on `main`.
