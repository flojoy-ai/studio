In this example, the `RAND` node generates a list of random numbers with a normal (or Gaussian) distribution.  

By having a large number of samples, which in this case is 2000 generated by the `LINSPACE` node,
the distribution can be easily seen with a `HISTOGRAM` node.

The distribution is then plotted with `HISTOGRAM` and as expected of a Gaussian distribution,
the output of the `HISTOGRAM` node converges towards a bell curve.

A `SCATTER` Viz node is also used to show the randomly generated numbers.
