# Git Best Practices
---
Here are a few easy ways to make sure your PR gets reviewed quickly, and your code gets merged as efficiently as possible.

## Scope your branches!
* To avoid name collsions please prefix your branch names with your name (e.g. use `sharif-my-cool-feature` not `my-cool-feature`)

## PRs should always be assigned to somebody.
* It's easy to lose track of who's supposed to do what when handing PRs back and forth. For that reason, please make sure to assign your PR to someone. Assign it to yourself if you're still working on it; assign it to your reviewer when you're waiting on review or clarification. 

## Use `Request Changes` liberally when reviewing.
* Leaving `Comment` reviews is fine for minor non-blocking comments. , but you should err on the side of using `Request Changes` rather than `Comment`. There is nothing rude about Requesting Changes! Don't understand the code? `Request changes` and ask for more comments! Don't see a test? `Request changes` and ask for one!

## Pinging on Slack is ok
If a PR has been sitting in someone's inbox for a day, it's fine to ping them on Slack.

## Use `[WIP]` or `[Draft]` if a PR isn't ready
Folks at FloJoy often merge each other's PRs, so make sure to prefix your PR's title and assign it to yourself if you're the one working on it.
