In this example, five `BASIC_OSCILLATOR` nodes generates an array of 400 samples with a sample rate of 100. 
Each with different amplitude and a unique frequency between 10-35hz. 
They are then all summed together into one signal using the `ADD` node.

To then get one of the initial sine waves, which is the one generated by `OSC_3` in this case, the `FIR` node
is used to filter out all other frequencies that's not 25hz.

For the filter type, it will be `bandpass` as there are unwanted frequencies both above and below 25hz.
The high cutoff would be 28hz and the low cutoff would be 23hz. For the window, `barthann` is used for
a sharper cutoff since we don't want any other frequencies in this example. 

For taps, there are a couple of ways of calculating depending on how much attenuation or how much ripple is in the signal.
[Here](https://dsp.stackexchange.com/questions/31066/how-many-taps-does-an-fir-filter-need) are some formulas, the top-rated answer
would be the one used in this example. With the transition width being 20, the number of taps would be 80 after calculation.

Finally, the output of `FIR` node will be displayed with the `LINE` node, which gives us a very similar graph to `OSC_3`.
Also, two `FFT` nodes are included to show the frequencies before and after the `FIR` node.
