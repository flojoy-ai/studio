In this example the `FUNCTION_GENERATOR_DS1047Z` block is used to control the `source` function of the Rigol DS1047Z oscilloscope. 

A `CONNECTION_DS1047Z` block must first be used to make the connection between Flojoy and the instrument.

Three different functions are used, and `TIMER` functions are used to delay the time between each one allowing the changes to take effect.
