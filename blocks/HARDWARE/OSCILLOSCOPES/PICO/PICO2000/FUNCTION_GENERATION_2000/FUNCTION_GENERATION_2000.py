    Parameters
    ----------
    offset_voltage: int
        The offset (vertical) voltage, in uV (microvolts).
    amplitude: int
        The peak-to-peak amplitude, in uV (microvolts).
    wave_type: select
        The type of waveform to generate (e.g. 0 is a sine)
    start_frequency: int
        The static or starting frequency, in Hz.
    end_frequency: int
        The ending frequency if sweeping is activated, in Hz.
    sweep_increment: int
        The increment to increase frequency during sweeping, in Hz
    dwell_time: int = 1,
        The time to dwell at a frequency during sweeping, in ms.
    sweep_type: Literal["0", "1", "2", "3"] = "0",
        The type of sweeping. 0 deactivates sweeping.
    sweeps: int = 0,
        The number of sweeps.
