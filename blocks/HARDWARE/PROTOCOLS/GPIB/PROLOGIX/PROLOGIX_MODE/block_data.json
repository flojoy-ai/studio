    "long_description": "From the Prologix manual:\n\nIn Controller mode, the GPIB-USB Controller acts as the Controller-In-Charge (CIC)\non the GPIB bus. When the controller receives a command over the USB port\nterminated by the USB terminator \u2013 CR (ASCII 13) or LF (ASCII 10) \u2013 it addresses the\nGPIB instrument at the currently specified address (See ++addr command) to listen, and\npasses along the received data.\n\nIn Device mode, Prologix GPIB-USB Controller acts as another peripheral on the GPIB\nbus. In this mode, the controller can act as a GPIB TALKER or GPIB LISTENER\nonly. Since Prologix GPIB-USB Controller is not the Controller-In-Charge while in this\nmode, it expects to receive commands from a GPIB controller. When Device mode is\nenabled Prologix GPIB-USB controller configures itself as a GPIB Listener. All data\nreceived by the controller over the GPIB port is passed along to the USB port without\nbuffering.\n\nInputs\n------\ndefault: DataContainer\n    Any DataContainer - likely connected to the output of the OPEN_SERIAL block.",
