Run this Block\nto change into CONTROLLER mode. You may have to repeat unplugging and\nreplugging into the computer.\n\nFrom the Prologix manual:\n\n`\nIn Controller mode, the GPIB-USB Controller acts as the\nController-In-Charge (CIC) on the GPIB bus. When the controller receives a\ncommand over the USB port terminated by the USB terminator - CR (ASCII 13)\nor LF (ASCII 10) - it addresses the GPIB instrument at the currently\nspecified address (See ++addr command) to listen, and passes along the\nreceived data.\n\nIn Device mode, Prologix GPIB-USB Controller acts as another peripheral on\nthe GPIB bus. In this mode, the controller can act as a GPIB TALKER or GPIB\nLISTENER only. Since Prologix GPIB-USB Controller is not the\nController-In-Charge while in this mode, it expects to receive commands\nfrom a GPIB controller. When Device mode is enabled Prologix GPIB-USB\ncontroller configures itself as a GPIB Listener. All data received by the\ncontroller over the GPIB port is passed along to the USB port without\nbuffering.\n`\n\nRequires an OPEN_SERIAL block.",
