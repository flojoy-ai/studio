In this example, Flojoy was used to extract an RF spectrum from a Tektronix RSA500.

First the necessary blocks were added:

- `EXTRACT_SPECTRUM_RSA500`
- `LINE`

The default parameters are set to the FM radio frequencies (100 MHz). Set `center_freq` to your favourite station and see the resulting spectrum.
