In this example, Flojoy was used to extract a DPX spectrum from a Tektronix RSA500.

First the necessary blocks were added:

- `DPX_RSA500`
- 2x `SURFACE`

Connect the blocks as shown an run the app. See [source](https://www.tek.com/en/documents/primer/dpx-acquisition-technology-spectrum-analyzers-fundamentals) for further technical explaination.
