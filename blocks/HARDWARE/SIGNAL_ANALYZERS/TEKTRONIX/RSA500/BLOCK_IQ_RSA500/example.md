In this example, Flojoy was used to extract I/Q data from a Tektronix RSA500.

First the necessary blocks were added:

- `BLOCK_IQ_RSA500`
- 2x `LINE`

Connect the blocks as shown an run the app. See [here](https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/textbook/radio-frequency-analysis-design/radio-frequency-demodulation/understanding-i-q-signals-and-quadrature-modulation/) for further technical explaination.
