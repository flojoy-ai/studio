Flojoy aims to revolutionize robotics visual programming and make robotics easy, useful, and powerful for all. 

This integration between block-based visual programming and industrial robotics delivers precision
and ease-of-use, ideal for detailed tasks in laboratory automation and electronics assembly. 
Additionally, incorporating Python's features, Flojoy supports advanced programming and machine learning tools visually,
making it a versatile tool in industrial and laboratory robotics. 

Our robotics programming interface currently supports Mecademic's Meca500 robot arm. We hope to integrate more robots in the future.


Flojoy's new robotics team aims to make robotics visual programming easy, useful, and powerful. We are currently  working on
multi-hardware connectivity and exploring natural language and human collaboration based robotics control methods.
