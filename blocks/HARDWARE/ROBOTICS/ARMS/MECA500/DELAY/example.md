In this example, the `DELAY` node introduces a pause in the robot arm's operation for a specified duration.

The node takes in the time for the delay in seconds.

After initiating the delay, the node waits for the robot arm to become idle before proceeding.

The `DELAY` node is useful in workflows where you need to introduce a pause between operations, such as waiting for an external sensor to trigger or allowing time for a mechanical process to complete.
