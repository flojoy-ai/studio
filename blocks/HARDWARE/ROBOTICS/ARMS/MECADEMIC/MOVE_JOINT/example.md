In this example, the `MOVE_JOINT` node moves the robot arm to a specified Cartesian position.

The node takes in the x, y, and z coordinates, along with optional alpha, beta, and gamma rotations in radians.

After initiating the movement, the node waits for the robot arm to become idle, indicating that the movement is complete.

The `MOVE_JOINT` node is commonly used in workflows where precise positioning of the robot arm is required, such as picking up an object or performing a specific task.
