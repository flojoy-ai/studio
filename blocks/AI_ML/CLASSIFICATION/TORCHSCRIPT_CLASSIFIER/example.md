In this example, the `TORCHSCRIPT_CLASSIFIER` loads the user-provided `.torchscript` model as well as the `.csv`
table that maps class indices to class names. The model is then used to classify the provided input image,
and it outputs the class name of the predicted class as well as a confidence score.
