In this example, the `WAVEPACKET` node simulates the behavior of a wavepacket in a box. The wavepacket is visualized by the `LINE` node, and the wavepacket is evolved through time with the use of the `LOOP` node.

The initial state of the `WAVEPACKET` node can be altered through the peak center (`center`), phase velocity (`momentum`), and width (`sigma`) parameters. The `box` can be altered with the box width (`L_box`) and time step (`dt`) parameters.
