This app shows how to use the `LOG` and `POWER` blocks.

Blocks used:

- `LOG`
- `POWER`
- `LINSPACE` (set to range from 0 to 10 with a size of 1000)
- `CONSTANT` (set to a scalar of 3)
- 2x `BIG_NUMBER`

The blocks were connected as shown and the app was run. The result is two functions: logarithmic and power functions. Note that these block can also be used with two scalars to calculate a normal logarithm or power.
