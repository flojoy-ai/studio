In this example, `DOUBLE_DEFINITE_INTEGRAL` node generates a Scalar type value with the following parameters.

Function: x*y

Upper_bound_x: 2

Lower_bound_x: 0

Upper_bound_y: 1

Lower_bound_y: 0

The `DOUBLE_DEFINITE_INTEGRAL` result is equal to 1. So 1 is added to the `SINE` node moving up every value of the sine function by 1. This difference is visible when you compare the two `SCATTER` nodes.
