This app uses ordered pair transformation techniques.

First the necessary blocks were added:

- `LINSPACE`
- `SINE`
- `ORDERED_PAIR_LENGTH`
- `ORDERED_PAIR_INDEXING`
- `ORDERED_PAIR_DELETE`
- 2x `BIG_NUMBER`
- `TABLE`

`LINSPACE` and `SINE` created an ordered pair data type (x and y axis pairs). `ORDERED_PAIR_LENGTH` extracts the length of an ordered pair (this length is viewed with `BIG_NUMBER` here). `ORDERED_PAIR_INDEXING` extracts a single value from either the x or y axes (this value is viewed with `BIG_NUMBER` here). `ORDERED_PAIR_DELETE` deletes single indexes from both the x or y axes and outputs a new ordered pair (the new ordered pair is viewed with `BIG_NUMBER` here).

The blocks were connected as shown and the app was run.
