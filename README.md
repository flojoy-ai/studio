# Flojoy Studio

Flojoy Studio is a desktop visual scripting IDE for running Python scripts - primarily for [DAQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_acquisition), test benches, robotics control, and no-code embedded systems.

Please see [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/flojoy-io/flojoy-desktop/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) to add your own custom Python nodes to Flojoy apps.

# Flojoy Quickstart

Please refer to below or the following link for installation guidelines: https://docs.flojoy.ai/getting-started/install/

For all operating systems, please first verify that you have [Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager), and [Git](https://git-scm.com/download) installed.

ðŸ†˜ Need help installing? Please ask on [community.flojoy.ai](https://community.flojoy.ai)

## Mac & Linux

Run the installation shell script:

```bash
curl -L https://docs.flojoy.ai/scripts/install.sh | sh
```

Flojoy Studio will open automatically after installation.

The next time that you wish to run Studio, simply navigate to the studio folder and run:

```bash
bash flojoy -v venv
```

## Windows

Run the following installation PowerShell script:

```bash
pwsh -Command "iwr https://docs.flojoy.ai/scripts/install.ps1 -useb | iex"
```

If you encounter an error saying that the pwsh command is not found, powershell can be used instead, though we recommend installing the [latest version of PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows).

Flojoy Studio will open automatically after installation.

The next time that you wish to run Studio, simply navigate to the studio folder and run:

```bash
.\flojoy -v venv
```
