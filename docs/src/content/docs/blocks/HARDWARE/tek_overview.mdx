## Introduction

Watch a video of Flojoy in action with a Tektronix AFG31000.

Flojoy makes instrumentation easy and powerful. The visual programming nature of Flojoy allows for easy control of instruments, but we've also built Flojoy to allow users to write their own custom Blocks.

You can also [request](https://toqo276pj36.typeform.com/to/F5rSHVu1) a custom Block that the team will create for you.

This documentation outlines the first few, of many, officially supported Tektronix instruments.

## Programming Tektronix Instruments with Flojoy

The majority of Tektronix instrument use [SCPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Commands_for_Programmable_Instruments) or [TSP](https://download.tek.com/document/1KW-61540-0_Script_with_TSP_Application_Note_031121.pdf). These instruments all have similar flow:

1. Establish Connection:
   - **`Connect`**: Begin by setting up the connection between Flojoy and the instrument (usually called `CONNECT_...`).
2. Configuration:
   - Blocks for programming the instruments settings (e.g. changing the voltage for a power supply).
3. Control:
   - Blocks for extracting data from the instrument and turning outputs on or off (e.g. turning on output on for a power supply).
4. Ending the program
   - Disconnection: When an app completes, instruments are _automatically_ disconnected until the next time the app is run.

## Example: Blocks for AFG31000

Most instrument blocks names follow the convention: `FUNCTION_INSTRUMENTNAME` such as `OUTPUT_AFG31000`.

#### Initialization Blocks

- **`CONNECT`**: Establishes the connection the AFG31000 (ethernet/TCPIP recommended).

- **`SAVE_STATE`**: Saves or recalls the instrument's state.

- **`RESET`**: Resets the instruments to it's default state.

#### Configuration Blocks

- **`FUNCTION`**: Sets the parameters for the built-in function generator.

- **`COPY`**: Copies the parameters from Channel 1 to channel 2 (or the reverse).

- **`ARBITRARY`**: Uses the Block's input data in Flojoy as a artitrary function.

- **`BASIC_PARAMETERS`**: Controls the frequency, phase, and voltages of the signals.

#### Control Blocks

- **`OUTPUT`**: Turns the output of the channels on or off.

- **`ALIGN_PHASES`**: Aligns the phases of the two channels, using one of them as the reference.
