## Discover the power of Flojoy

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="ü§ñ AI & ML">
    Run pre-trained, foundation models on your data in Flojoy's drag & drop
    environment. Apply these models to data from the physical world by
    combining them with sensors, robotics, and benchtop instruments.
  </Card>
  <Card title="ü©ª Image Processing">
    Flojoy supports standard image processing functions such as logical and
    arithmetical operations between images, contrast manipulation, convolution,
    Fourier analysis, sharpening, smoothing, edge detection, and median filtering.
  </Card>
  <Card title="üì° Signal Processing">
    Design and analyze FIR, IIR, multistage, and adaptive filters. Signals can
    be streamed from simulation variables, data files on disk, or bench-top
    instruments and DAQ boards. For deployment to microcontrollers and
    single-board computers, Flojoy supports Python and MicroPython-compatible
    code generation.
  </Card>
  <Card title="üìª Instrument Control">
    Flojoy provides apps and functions for configuring data acquisition hardware,
    reading data into Flojoy, and writing data to DAQ output channels.
    Flojoy supports a variety of hardware, including those from National
    Instruments¬Æ, Tektronix¬Æ, and others.
  </Card>
  <Card title="‚è≤Ô∏è Loops & Timers">
    Flojoy has an expressive set of functions ("nodes") for controlling app
    execution flow - including timers, loops, and if statements. Learn how to
    add these logic expressions to your Flojoy apps through our simple examples.
  </Card>
  <Card title="üõ†Ô∏è Build Your Own">
    Follow our guides to write your own custom Flojoy functions ("nodes") and apps.
    Only beginner-level Python knowhow is required.
