The DG645 is a versatile digital delay/pulse generator that provides precisely defined pulses at repetition rates up to 10 MHz. The instrument offers several improvements over older designs—lower jitter, higher accuracy, faster trigger rates, and more outputs. The DG645 also has Ethernet, GPIB and RS-232 interfaces for computer or network control of the instrument.

## Connect to the Srs dg645 in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/contribution/blocks/custom-flojoy-block/)

import NodeCardCollection from "@root/src/components/NodeCardCollection";

To connect to a DG645 Pulse Generator using Instrumentkit, you can use the following code:

```python
import instrumentkit as ik

# Connect to the DG645 Pulse Generator
dg645 = ik.srs.SRSDG645.open_gpibusb('/dev/ttyUSB0', 1)

# Example usage
dg645.channel[dg645.Channels.A].delay = (dg645.channel[dg645.Channels.T0], 10 * ik.units.ns)
dg645.output[dg645.Outputs.AB].level_amplitude = 4.0 * ik.units.V
# Close the connection
dg645.close()
```

This code imports the `instrumentkit` module and opens a connection to the DG645 Pulse Generator using the `open_gpibusb` method of the `SRSDG645` class. The first argument is the device path (`'/dev/ttyUSB0'`) and the second argument is the GPIB address (`1`).

After connecting, you can access the channels and outputs of the DG645 Pulse Generator using the `channel` and `output` properties. In the example usage, it sets the delay of channel A to 10 nanoseconds relative to channel T0 and sets the amplitude of output AB to 4.0 volts.

```python
from qcodes import Station, Instrument
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.stanford_research.DG645 import DG645

# Create a station to hold the instruments
station = Station()

# Connect to the DG645 Pulse Generator
dg645 = DG645('dg645', 'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR')
station.add_component(dg645)

# Print the available parameters of the DG645
print(dg645.parameters)

# Set the trigger level to 0.5V
dg645.trigger_level(0.5)

# Set the trigger rate to 1kHz
dg645.trigger_rate(1000)

# Set the trigger source to external rising edge
dg645.trigger_source('ext_rising')

# Set the burst count to 10
dg645.burst_count(10)

# Set the burst delay to 1ms
dg645.burst_delay(0.001)

# Set the burst period to 1s
dg645.burst_period(1)

# Set the burst T0 configuration to 1
dg645.burst_T0_config(1)

# Set the delay of channel A relative to channel T0 to 1ms
dg645.delay_A('2,+0.001')

# Set the delay of channel B relative to channel T0 to 2ms
dg645.delay_B('2,+0.002')

# Set the amplitude of output T0 to 1V
dg645.amp_out_T0(1)

# Set the offset of output T0 to 0V
dg645.offset_out_T0(0)

# Set the polarity of output T0 to positive
dg645.polarity_out_T0(1)

# Trigger the pulse generator
dg645.trigger()

# Close the connection to the instruments
station.close_all()
```

This script connects to a DG645 Pulse Generator using its IP address and sets various parameters such as trigger level, trigger rate, trigger source, burst count, burst delay, burst period, burst T0 configuration, channel delays, output amplitudes, output offsets, and output polarities. Finally, it triggers the pulse generator and closes the connection to the instruments.
