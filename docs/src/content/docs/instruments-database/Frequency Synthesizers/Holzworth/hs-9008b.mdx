## Connect to the HS 9008B in Python

To connect to a HS 9008B Frequency synthesizer using Instrumentkit, you can use the following Python script:

```python
import instrumentkit as ik

# Connect to the HS 9008B Frequency synthesizer
hs = ik.holzworth.HS9000.open_tcpip("192.168.0.2", 8080)

# Access the channels and retrieve their frequency
for channel in hs.channel:
    print(channel.frequency)

# Access the channels on the HS 9008B
channel_1 = hs.channel[0]
channel_2 = hs.channel[1]

# Get the frequency of channel 1
frequency_1 = channel_1.frequency
print(f"Frequency of channel 1: {frequency_1}")

# Set the frequency of channel 2 to 1 GHz
channel_2.frequency = 1 * ik.units.GHz

# Get the power of channel 2
power_2 = channel_2.power
print(f"Power of channel 2: {power_2}")

# Turn on the output of channel 1
channel_1.output = True

# Check if the HS 9008B is ready
is_ready = hs.ready
print(f"Is HS 9008B ready: {is_ready}")
```

This script imports the `instrumentkit` module as `ik` and then uses the `open_tcpip` method of the `HS9000` class to connect to the HS 9008B Frequency synthesizer at the specified IP address and port number.

After connecting, you can access the channels of the synthesizer using the `channel` property of the `HS9000` object. In the example script, it loops over all the channels and prints their frequencies. 

It then performs various operations such as getting and setting the frequency and power of the channels, and turning on the output of a channel. Finally, it checks if the synthesizer is ready for operation.

Note: Make sure to replace `"192.168.0.2"` with the actual IP address of your HS 9008B Frequency synthesizer and `8080` with the appropriate port number.
