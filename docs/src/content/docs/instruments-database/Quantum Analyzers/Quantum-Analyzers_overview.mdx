## Quantum Analyzers

<details> 
<summary>Category Description</summary> 
The SHFQA enables multi-state discrimination with optimal signal-to-noise ratio and minimal latency thanks to its advanced sequencer and its low-latency signal processing chain with matched filters and result correlation. The data are transmitted in real-time to other instruments for active qubit reset or global error correction protocols. Controlled through the LabOne software suite comprising the user interface, several APIs and LabOne Q, the SHFQA supports quantum computing projects with sizes ranging from a few to several hundreds of qubits.
