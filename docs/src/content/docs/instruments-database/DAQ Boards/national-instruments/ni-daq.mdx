## Connect to the NI DAQ in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/contribution/blocks/custom-flojoy-block/)

import SectionsCard from "@root/src/components/SectionsCard";

To connect to a NI DAQ board using Qcodes Community, you can use the following Python script:

```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes_contrib_drivers.drivers.NI_DAQ import DAQAnalogInputs, DAQAnalogOutputs, DAQDigitalOutputs

# Create a connection to the NI DAQ board
daq = qc.Instrument('daq', 'DAQAnalogInputs', dev_name='Dev1', rate=1000, channels={'ch1': 0})

# Read analog input voltage
voltage = daq.voltage.get()

# Write analog output voltage
daq_ao = qc.Instrument('daq_ao', 'DAQAnalogOutputs', dev_name='Dev1', channels={'ch1': 0})
daq_ao.voltage_ch1.set(1.23)

# Write digital output state
daq_do = qc.Instrument('daq_do', 'DAQDigitalOutputs', dev_name='Dev1', lines=['port0/line0'])
daq_do.state.set(True)
```

Note: Replace `'Dev1'` with the appropriate device name for your NI DAQ board, and adjust the channel and line configurations as needed.
