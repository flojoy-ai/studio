## Instrument Card

Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCIe or PCI-E) is a serial expansion bus standard for connecting a computer to one or more peripheral devices.

PCIE-1751 is a 48-bit digital I/O card for the PCI Express bus. Its 48 channels are divided into six 8-bit I/O ports and users can configure each 4-channel per port (nibble) as input or output via software. PCIE-1751 also provides three 32-bit counters.
