title: Connecting to Keithley 2614B by Keithley in Python
description: The 2614B SourceMeter SMU Instrument is a new dual-channel SMU instrument with best-in-class value and performance. Its tightly integrated, four-quadrant design allows it to simultaneously source and measure both voltage and current to boost productivity in R&D and bench-top applications. The Model 2614B is equipped with Keithley's high speed TSP technology, which is over 190% faster than traditional PC-to-instrument communication techniques. The Model 2614B is designed for bench-top applications and, therefore, does not have the high-end, system-level automation features of the Model 2612B SourceMeter SMU Instrument, which includes digital I/O, TSP-Link technology, and contact check function.

## Connect to the Keithley 2614B in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/contribution/blocks/custom-flojoy-block/)

import SectionsCard from "@root/src/components/SectionsCard";

Here's an example Python script that uses Qcodes to connect to a Keithley 2614B Power Supply:

```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.tektronix.Keithley_2600_channels import Keithley2600

# Create a connection to the Keithley 2614B Power Supply
keithley = Keithley2600('keithley', 'TCPIP::192.168.1.1::INSTR')

# Connect to the instrument
keithley.connect()

# Print the instrument ID
print(keithley.get_idn())

# Set the voltage and current limits
keithley.smua.limitv(10)  # Set voltage limit to 10V
keithley.smua.limiti(0.1)  # Set current limit to 0.1A

# Enable the output
keithley.smua.output(1)  # Turn on the output

# Set the voltage and current levels
keithley.smua.volt(5)  # Set voltage to 5V
keithley.smua.curr(0.05)  # Set current to 0.05A

# Measure the voltage and current
voltage = keithley.smua.volt()
current = keithley.smua.curr()
print(f"Voltage: {voltage} V")
print(f"Current: {current} A")

# Disable the output
keithley.smua.output(0)  # Turn off the output

# Disconnect from the instrument
keithley.disconnect()
```

Note: Replace `'TCPIP::192.168.1.1::INSTR'` with the actual IP address or VISA resource address of your Keithley 2614B Power Supply.
