title: Connecting to Keithley 2450 by Keithley in Python
description: The 2450 is Keithley's next-generation SourceMeter source measure unit (SMU) instrument that truly brings Ohm's law (current, voltage, and resistance) testing right to your fingertips. Its innovative graphical user interface (GUI) and advanced, capacitive touchscreen technology allow intuitive usage and minimize the learning curve to enable engineers and scientists to learn faster, work smarter, and invent easier. The 2450 is the SMU for everyone, a versatile instrument, particularly well-suited for characterizing modern scaled semiconductors, nano-scale devices and materials, organic semiconductors, printed electronics, and other small-geometry and low-power devices.

## Connect to the Keithley 2450 in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/contribution/blocks/custom-flojoy-block/)

Here is a Python script that uses Pymeasure to connect to a Keithley 2450 Power Supply:

```python
from pymeasure.adapters import VISAAdapter
from pymeasure.instruments.keithley import Keithley2450

# Create a connection to the instrument
adapter = VISAAdapter("GPIB::1")
keithley = Keithley2450(adapter)

# Enable the source and set the current range
keithley.enable_source()
keithley.source_current_range = 10e-3

# Set the compliance voltage and source current
keithley.compliance_voltage = 10
keithley.source_current = 0

# Measure voltage
keithley.measure_voltage()

# Ramp the current to 5 mA and print the voltage
keithley.ramp_to_current(5e-3)
print(keithley.voltage)

# Shutdown the instrument
keithley.shutdown()
```

This script connects to the Keithley 2450 Power Supply using a VISA adapter with the address "GPIB::1". It enables the source, sets the current range to 10 mA, sets the compliance voltage to 10 V, and sets the source current to 0 mA. It then measures the voltage, ramps the current to 5 mA, and prints the voltage. Finally, it shuts down the instrument.
