title: Connecting to Keithley 2635B by Keithley in Python
description: The 2635B SourceMeter SMU instrument, is a new and improved one-channel SMU instrument with a tightly integrated four-quadrant design that allows it to simultaneously source and measure both voltage and current to boost productivity in applications ranging from R&D to automated production test. The wide range of 1.5A DC, 10A pulse, 200V output and 0.1fA measurement resolution makes it ideal to test a wide range of lower current devices and materials. In addition to retaining all the features of the Model 2635A, the Model 2635B has 6½-digit resolution, USB 2.0 connectivity, and software command emulation of the Model 2400 SourceMeter SMU Instrument to enable easy migration of legacy test code. The Model 2635B is equipped with Keithley's high speed TSP technology (over 190% faster than traditional PC-to-instrument communication techniques,) which dramatically improves the system-level speed to lower the cost of test.

## Connect to the Keithley 2635B in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/contribution/blocks/custom-flojoy-block/)

import SectionsCard from "@root/src/components/SectionsCard";

Here's an example Python script that uses Qcodes to connect to a Keithley 2635B Power Supply:

```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.tektronix.Keithley_2600 import Keithley2600

# Connect to the Keithley 2635B Power Supply
keithley = Keithley2600("keithley", "TCPIP::192.168.1.1::INSTR")

# Print the instrument ID
print(keithley.get_idn())

# Set the voltage and current limits
keithley.smua.limitv(10)  # Set voltage limit to 10V
keithley.smua.limiti(0.1)  # Set current limit to 0.1A

# Enable the output
keithley.smua.output(1)  # Turn on the output

# Set the voltage and current levels
keithley.smua.volt(5)  # Set the voltage to 5V
keithley.smua.curr(0.05)  # Set the current to 0.05A

# Measure the voltage and current
voltage = keithley.smua.volt()
current = keithley.smua.curr()
print(f"Voltage: {voltage}V, Current: {current}A")

# Disable the output
keithley.smua.output(0)  # Turn off the output

# Close the connection
keithley.close()
```

Note: Replace `"TCPIP::192.168.1.1::INSTR"` with the actual IP address or VISA resource address of your Keithley 2635B Power Supply.
