title: Connecting to Keithley 2634B by Keithley in Python
description: The 2634B SourceMeter SMU instrument is a new dual-channel SMU instrument with best-in-class value and performance. Its tightly-integrated, four-quadrant design allows it to simultaneously source and measure both voltage and current to boost productivity in R&D and bench-top applications. The wide range of 1.5A DC, 10A pulse, 200V output and 1fA measurement resolution makes it suitable to test a wide range of lower current devices and materials. The Model 2634B is equipped with Keithley's high speed TSP technology, which is over 190% faster than traditional PC-to-instrument communication techniques. The Model 2634B is designed for bench-top applications and, therefore, does not have the high-end, system-level automation features of the Model 2636B SourceMeter SMU Instrument that includes digital I/O, TSP-Link technology, and contact check function.

## Connect to the Keithley 2634B in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/contribution/blocks/custom-flojoy-block/)

import SectionsCard from "@root/src/components/SectionsCard";

<TabItem value="QCodes" label="QCodes">

Here's an example Python script that uses Qcodes to connect to a Keithley 2634B Power Supply:

```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.tektronix.Keithley_2600_channels import Keithley2600

# Create an instance of the Keithley 2634B instrument
keithley = Keithley2600('keithley', 'TCPIP::192.168.1.1::INSTR')

# Connect to the instrument
keithley.connect()

# Print the instrument ID
print(keithley.get_idn())

# Set the voltage source range to 1V
keithley.smuA.sourcerange_v(1)

# Set the current limit to 100mA
keithley.smuA.limiti(0.1)

# Enable the output
keithley.smuA.output(1)

# Set the voltage to 0.5V
keithley.smuA.volt(0.5)

# Set the current to 50mA
keithley.smuA.curr(0.05)

# Disable the output
keithley.smuA.output(0)

# Disconnect from the instrument
keithley.disconnect()
```

Note: Replace `'TCPIP::192.168.1.1::INSTR'` with the actual IP address or VISA resource address of your Keithley 2634B Power Supply.
