title: Connecting to Qdac 2 Array by Qdevil in Python
description: QDAC-II is the next generation of the successful QDAC from QDevil. It has all the outstanding features from its predecessor but is even more versatile and with superior performance. QDAC-II is a high-precision ultra-low-noise computer controlled DAC with 24 voltage generators, operating at a sample rate of 1MS/s – a thousand times faster than its predecessor. It is designed for DC and intermediate-frequency control of quantum devices, including, for example, gate electrodes and flux bias coils in qubits, but is a very versatile instrument that can be used for many other purposes. Each of the 24 channels has five voltage generators working in parallel, One for DC, a sine generator, a triangle generator, a square wave generator, and an arbitrary waveform generator (1 million points/second). Additionally, each channel is equipped with a DC current sensor with a resolution down to a few tens of pA, typically used for gate leakage detection and with sample rates up to 3 kHz.

## Connect to the Qdac 2 Array in Python

To connect to a Qdac 2 Array Power Supplies using Qcodes Community, you can use the following code:

```python
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.QDevil.QDAC2 import QDac2_Array

# Create an instance of the QDac2_Array driver
qdac_array = QDac2_Array(controller, listeners)

# Connect to the Qdac 2 Array Power Supplies
qdac_array.sync()

# Perform operations on the Qdac 2 Array Power Supplies
# ...

# Close the connection to the Qdac 2 Array Power Supplies
qdac_array.close()
```

In the code above, you need to replace `controller` and `listeners` with the actual instances of the QDac2 instruments that you want to connect to. The `sync()` method is used to synchronize the array of QDac2 instruments. You can then perform various operations on the Qdac 2 Array Power Supplies using the `qdac_array` object. Finally, you can close the connection using the `close()` method.
