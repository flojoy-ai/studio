title: Connecting to Qdac 2 by Qdevil in Python
description: QDAC-II is the next generation of the successful QDAC from QDevil. It has all the outstanding features from its predecessor but is even more versatile and with superior performance. QDAC-II is a high-precision ultra-low-noise computer controlled DAC with 24 voltage generators, operating at a sample rate of 1MS/s – a thousand times faster than its predecessor. It is designed for DC and intermediate-frequency control of quantum devices, including, for example, gate electrodes and flux bias coils in qubits, but is a very versatile instrument that can be used for many other purposes. Each of the 24 channels has five voltage generators working in parallel, One for DC, a sine generator, a triangle generator, a square wave generator, and an arbitrary waveform generator (1 million points/second). Additionally, each channel is equipped with a DC current sensor with a resolution down to a few tens of pA, typically used for gate leakage detection and with sample rates up to 3 kHz.

## Connect to the Qdac 2 in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/contribution/blocks/custom-flojoy-block/)

To connect to a Qdac 2 Power Supply using Qcodes Community, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary modules:

```python
from qcodes.instrument.visa import VisaInstrument
from qcodes.instrument.channel import ChannelList
from qcodes.instrument.parameter import Parameter
```

2. Create a class for the Qdac 2 Power Supply:

```python
class QDac2(VisaInstrument):
    def __init__(self, name, address):
        super().__init__(name, address)

        # Add channels to the instrument
        self.channels = ChannelList(self, "Channels", QDac2Channel, snapshotable=False)
        for i in range(1, 9):
            channel = QDac2Channel(self, f"ch{i}", i)
            self.channels.append(channel)
            self.add_submodule(f"ch{i}", channel)
```

3. Create a class for the Qdac 2 Power Supply channel:

```python
class QDac2Channel(Parameter):
    def __init__(self, parent, name, channum):
        super().__init__(name, label=f"Channel {channum}", unit="V", parent=parent)
        self.channum = channum

    def get_raw(self):
        return self.instrument.ask(f"get_voltage {self.channum}")

    def set_raw(self, value):
        self.instrument.write(f"set_voltage {self.channum} {value}")
```

4. Connect to the Qdac 2 Power Supply:

```python
qdac = QDac2("qdac", "TCPIP::192.168.1.1::INSTR")
qdac.connect()
```

5. Access and control the channels of the Qdac 2 Power Supply:

```python
channel1 = qdac.channels[0]
channel1.set(1.0)
voltage = channel1.get()
print(voltage)
```

Note: Replace "TCPIP::192.168.1.1::INSTR" with the actual IP address of your Qdac 2 Power Supply.

This code provides a basic example of how to connect to and control a Qdac 2 Power Supply using Qcodes Community. You can modify and expand upon this code to suit your specific needs.
