title: Connecting to Yokogawa 7651 by Yokogawa in Python
description: The 7651 is a general-purpose DC source developed on YOKOGAWA's state-of-the-art DC standard technology. The dual multiplying D/A converter has enabled the compatibility of high-speed response and high resolution. The 7651 also provides high accuracy and stability. In addition to the source function (current supply), the sink function (current absorption) is also available, so the 7651 can be used as not only DC voltage/current source but also high-precision electronic load. Further, a series of powerful functions to meet the system use such as the programming function up to 50 steps, the IC memory card capable of storing 7 patterns of programs, and GP-IB interface are provided as standard. This 7651 can be used for a wide range of fields from R & D to production line, service and maintenance.

## Connect to the Yokogawa 7651 in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/contribution/blocks/custom-flojoy-block/)

import SectionsCard from "@root/src/components/SectionsCard";

To connect to a Yokogawa 7651 Power Supply using Instrumentkit, you can use the following Python script:

```python
import instrumentkit as ik

# Connect to the Yokogawa 7651 Power Supply
yokogawa = ik.yokogawa.Yokogawa7651.open_gpibusb('/dev/ttyUSB0', 1)

# Set the voltage to 10V
yokogawa.voltage = 10 * ik.units.V

# Set the current to 50mA
yokogawa.current = 50 * ik.units.mA

# Enable the output
yokogawa.channel[0].output = True

# Disable the output
yokogawa.channel[0].output = False
```

This script imports the `instrumentkit` module as `ik` and uses the `open_gpibusb` method of the `Yokogawa7651` class to connect to the power supply. The first argument is the device path (`/dev/ttyUSB0`) and the second argument is the GPIB address (1).

Once connected, you can set the voltage and current using the `voltage` and `current` properties of the `Yokogawa7651` object. The values are specified using the `ik.units` module to provide the units (e.g., `10 * ik.units.V` for 10 volts).

You can also enable or disable the output using the `output` property of the power supply channel. Set it to `True` to enable the output and `False` to disable it.

Note that the script assumes you have already installed the `instrumentkit` package and its dependencies.
