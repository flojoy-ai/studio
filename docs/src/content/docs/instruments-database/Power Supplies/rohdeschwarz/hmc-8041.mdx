## Connect to the HMC 8041 in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/contribution/blocks/custom-flojoy-block/)

import NodeCardCollection from "@root/src/components/NodeCardCollection";

To connect to a Rohde & Schwarz HMC8041 Power Supply using Qcodes Community, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.rohde_schwarz.HMC8041 import RohdeSchwarzHMC8041

# Create an instance of the RohdeSchwarzHMC8041 driver
power_supply = RohdeSchwarzHMC8041('power_supply', 'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::INSTR')

# Connect to the power supply
power_supply.connect()

# Now you can use the power supply to perform various operations
# For example, to set the voltage of channel 1 to 5V:
power_supply.ch1.voltage.set(5)

# To turn on channel 1:
power_supply.ch1.output.set(True)

# To turn off channel 1:
power_supply.ch1.output.set(False)

# Disconnect from the power supply
power_supply.disconnect()
```

Note that you need to replace `'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::INSTR'` with the actual IP address or VISA resource string of your HMC8041 Power Supply.
