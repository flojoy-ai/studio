This code defines a class `razorbillRP100` that represents a Razorbill RP100 strain cell controller. It inherits from the `Instrument` class provided by the `pymeasure.instruments` module.

The class provides various control and measurement properties for interacting with the Razorbill RP100 power supply. Here's a breakdown of the properties:

- `output_1`: A control property that turns the output of channel 1 on or off. It accepts a boolean value and maps it to 1 or 0 in the command string.
- `output_2`: Similar to `output_1`, but for channel 2.
- `voltage_1`: A control property that sets or queries the output voltage of channel 1. It accepts a float value within the range [-230, 230].
- `voltage_2`: Similar to `voltage_1`, but for channel 2.
- `slew_rate_1`: A control property that sets or queries the source slew rate in volts/sec of channel 1. It accepts a float value within the range [0.1 * 10e-3, 100 * 10e3].
- `slew_rate_2`: Similar to `slew_rate_1`, but for channel 2.
- `instant_voltage_1`: A measurement property that returns the instantaneous output of source one in volts.
- `instant_voltage_2`: Similar to `instant_voltage_1`, but for source two.
- `contact_voltage_1`: A measurement property that returns the voltage in volts present at the front panel output of channel 1.
- `contact_voltage_2`: Similar to `contact_voltage_1`, but for channel 2.
- `contact_current_1`: A measurement property that returns the current in amps present at the front panel output of channel 1.
- `contact_current_2`: Similar to `contact_current_1`, but for channel 2.

The `razorbillRP100` class also has an `__init__` method that initializes the instrument with the provided adapter and sets a timeout of 20 seconds.
