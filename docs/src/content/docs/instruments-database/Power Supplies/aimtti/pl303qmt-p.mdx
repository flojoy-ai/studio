## Connect to the PL303QMT-P in Python

Here is a Python script that uses Qcodes to connect to a PL303QMT-P Power Supply:

```python
from qcodes.instrument.visa import VisaInstrument
from qcodes.instrument.channel import ChannelList

class AimTTiChannel(VisaInstrument):
    def __init__(self, name, address, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(name, address, terminator="\n", **kwargs)
        self.add_parameter(
            "volt",
            get_cmd="V?",
            get_parser=float,
            set_cmd="V {}",
            label="Voltage",
            unit="V",
        )
        self.add_parameter(
            "curr",
            get_cmd="I?",
            get_parser=float,
            set_cmd="I {}",
            label="Current",
            unit="A",
        )

class AimTTi(VisaInstrument):
    def __init__(self, name, address, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(name, address, terminator="\n", **kwargs)
        channels = ChannelList(self, "Channels", AimTTiChannel, snapshotable=False)
        for i in range(1, 4):
            channel = AimTTiChannel(self, f"ch{i}", f"ch{i}")
            channels.append(channel)
            self.add_submodule(f"ch{i}", channel)
        self.add_submodule("channels", channels.to_channel_tuple())
        self.connect_message()

aim_tti = AimTTi("aim_tti", "TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR")
```

This script defines two classes: `AimTTiChannel` and `AimTTi`. `AimTTiChannel` represents a single channel of the Aim TTi power supply and `AimTTi` represents the entire power supply instrument.

In the `AimTTiChannel` class, two parameters are defined: `volt` and `curr`. These parameters allow you to get and set the voltage and current values of the channel.

In the `AimTTi` class, a `ChannelList` is created to hold the channels of the power supply. The number of channels is set to 3. Each channel is represented by an instance of `AimTTiChannel` and added as a submodule to the `AimTTi` instrument.

Finally, an instance of `AimTTi` is created with the name "aim_tti" and the VISA address of the power supply.
