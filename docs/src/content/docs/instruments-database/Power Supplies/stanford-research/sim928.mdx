title: Connecting to SIM928 by Stanford Research Systems in Python
description: The SIM928 Isolated Voltage Source is ideal for applications where ultra-clean DC voltage is required. Voltage can be set between ±20 VDC with millivolt resolution, and the source can drive up to ±10 mA. The output circuit is optically isolated from all earth-referenced charging circuitry, providing maximum flexibility and noise immunity. The system can float to ±40 V, and the output is short-circuit protected.

## Connect to the SIM928 in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/contribution/blocks/custom-flojoy-block/)

To connect to a SIM928 Power Supply using Qcodes Community, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes.instrument.visa import VisaInstrument

class SIM928(VisaInstrument):
    def __init__(self, name, address, **kw):
        super().__init__(name, address=address, terminator='\n', **kw)
        self.add_parameter('voltage', unit='V', get_cmd='VOLT?', set_cmd='VOLT {:.3f}')
        self.add_parameter('current', unit='A', get_cmd='CURR?', set_cmd='CURR {:.3f}')
        self.add_parameter('output', get_cmd='OUTP?', set_cmd='OUTP {}', val_mapping={True: 'ON', False: 'OFF'})
        self.connect_message()

sim928 = SIM928('sim928', 'YOUR_VISA_ADDRESS')

print(sim928.voltage())
sim928.voltage(5)
print(sim928.voltage())
```

Replace `'YOUR_VISA_ADDRESS'` with the actual VISA address of your SIM928 Power Supply.
