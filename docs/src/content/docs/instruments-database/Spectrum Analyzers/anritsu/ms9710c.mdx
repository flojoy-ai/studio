## Connect to the MS9710C in Python

```python
from pymeasure.instruments.anritsu import AnritsuMS9710C

# Connect to the Spectrum Analyzer
spectrum_analyzer = AnritsuMS9710C("TCPIP::192.168.1.1::INSTR")

# Perform a single sweep and wait for completion
spectrum_analyzer.single_sweep()

# Measure the peak and get the trace marker
peak = spectrum_analyzer.measure_peak()
print("Peak:", peak)

# Read the scan saved in memory slot A
wavelengths, power = spectrum_analyzer.read_memory(slot="A")
print("Wavelengths:", wavelengths)
print("Power:", power)

# Disconnect from the Spectrum Analyzer
spectrum_analyzer.disconnect()
```

In this script, we first import the `AnritsuMS9710C` class from `pymeasure.instruments.anritsu`. Then, we create an instance of the `AnritsuMS9710C` class by providing the instrument's address (e.g., `"TCPIP::192.168.1.1::INSTR"`).

Next, we perform a single sweep using the `single_sweep()` method of the spectrum analyzer. This method sends the command to initiate a spectrum sweep and waits for the sweep to complete.

After that, we use the `measure_peak()` method to measure the peak of the spectrum and get the trace marker. The method sets the peak search mode to "PEAK" and returns the wavelength and power of the peak.

Finally, we read the scan saved in memory slot A using the `read_memory()` method. This method retrieves the wavelength and power values from the memory slot and returns them as numpy arrays.

Note: Make sure to replace `"TCPIP::192.168.1.1::INSTR"` with the actual address of your Anritsu MS9710C Spectrum Analyzer.
