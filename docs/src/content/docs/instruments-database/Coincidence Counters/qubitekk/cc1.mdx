## Connect to the CC1 in Python

```python
import instrumentkit as ik

# Connect to the CC1 Coincidence Counter
cc1 = ik.qubitekk.CC1.open_serial('COM8', 19200, timeout=1)

# Get the firmware version
firmware_version = cc1.firmware
print(f"Firmware version: {firmware_version}")

# Set the dwell time to 1 second
cc1.dwell_time = 1

# Get the counts of the first channel
channel_1_count = cc1.channel[0].count
print(f"Channel 1 count: {channel_1_count}")

# Enable the gate
cc1.gate = True

# Enable the subtract feature
cc1.subtract = True

# Set the trigger mode to continuous
cc1.trigger_mode = "continuous"

# Set the coincidence window to 5 ns
cc1.window = 5

# Set the delay on Channel 1 to 4 ns
cc1.delay = 4

# Clear the current total counts on the counters
cc1.clear_counts()

# Disconnect from the CC1 Coincidence Counter
cc1.close()
```

This script demonstrates how to connect to the CC1 Coincidence Counter, retrieve the firmware version, set various properties such as dwell time, gate, subtract, trigger mode, coincidence window, and delay, as well as clear the counts and disconnect from the instrument.
