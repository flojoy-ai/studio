## Connect to the Daqmx in Python

```python
from pymeasure.instruments.agilent import Agilent4156

# Connect to the instrument
instrument = Agilent4156("GPIB0::25")

# Reset the instrument
instrument.reset()

# Configure the instrument using a JSON configuration file
instrument.configure("configuration_file.json")

# Save the desired data variables
instrument.save(['VC', 'IC', 'VB', 'IB'])

# Perform a measurement
instrument.measure()

# Get the measured data as a pandas DataFrame
data = instrument.get_data()

# Print the data
print(data)
```

In this example, you would need to replace `"GPIB0::25"` with the appropriate address of your Keysight (Agilent) 4156C Spectrum Analyzer. You would also need to provide a valid JSON configuration file for the `configure` method.

The script connects to the instrument, resets it, configures it using the JSON file, saves the desired data variables, performs a measurement, and retrieves the measured data as a pandas DataFrame. Finally, it prints the data.

Note that you may need to install the `pandas` library if it's not already installed. You can do this by running `pip install pandas` in your terminal.
