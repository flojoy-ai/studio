## Connect to the Photometrics - Cameras in Python

Unfortunately, the provided code does not include any implementation for connecting to a Kinetix sCMOS camera using Instrumental. The code is specific to Photometrics cameras and the PVCam driver. 

To connect to a Kinetix sCMOS camera using Instrumental, you would need to find or develop a separate driver specifically for that camera model. The driver would need to implement the necessary functions and communication protocols to interact with the camera.

Once you have the driver, you can use Instrumental's `Instrument` class to connect to the camera and interact with it. Here's an example of how you can connect to a Kinetix sCMOS-all_cameras camera using Instrumental:

```python
from instrumental import instrument, list_instruments

# Find the Kinetix sCMOS-all_cameras camera in the list of available instruments
kinetix_cameras = [cam for cam in list_instruments() if cam['module'] == 'cameras.kinetix_scmos']

if len(kinetix_cameras) == 0:
    raise InstrumentNotFoundError("Kinetix sCMOS-all_cameras camera not found")

# Connect to the first Kinetix sCMOS-all_cameras camera found
camera = instrument(kinetix_cameras[0])

# Now you can use the camera object to control the camera and capture images
camera.start_live_video()
image = camera.get_captured_image()
camera.stop_live_video()

# Do something with the captured image
print(image)
```

Note that the above code assumes you have a driver for the Kinetix sCMOS-all_cameras camera and it is properly installed and accessible to Instrumental.
