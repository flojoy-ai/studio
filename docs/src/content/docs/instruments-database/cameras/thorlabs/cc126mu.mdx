## Connect to the Thorlabs Tsi (All Cameras) in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/contribution/blocks/custom-flojoy-block/)

import NodeCardCollection from "@root/src/components/NodeCardCollection";

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="Flojoy" label="Flojoy" className="flojoy-instrument-tabs">

<NodeCardCollection category='CAMERAS' manufacturer='THORLABS'></NodeCardCollection>

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Instrumental" label="Instrumental">

To connect to a CC126Mu camera using Instrumental, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from instrumental import instrument, list_instruments

# List all available instruments
cameras = list_instruments()

# Connect to the first camera
camera = instrument(cameras[0])

# Perform operations on the camera
# For example, get the camera name
name = camera.name
print("Camera Name:", name)

# Close the connection to the camera
camera.close()
```

This script first lists all available instruments using the `list_instruments()` function from Instrumental. Then, it connects to the first camera in the list using the `instrument()` function. You can perform various operations on the camera, such as getting the camera name using the `name` property. Finally, the script closes the connection to the camera using the `close()` method.
