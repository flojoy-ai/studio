title: Connecting to APT Stepper Motor Control Module by Thorlabs in Python
description: The APT™ MST602 module is a dual-channel, high-resolution, rack-mounted stepper motor driver designed for use with the APT MMR601 Motion Control 19" Modular Rack System. It has been designed to drive 2-phase bi-polar stepper motors up to 50 W, with or without encoder feedback, and is compatible with the full range of stepper-motor-equipped nanopositioning actuators and stages offered by Thorlabs. Alternatively, it is also compatible with any generic two-phase bi-polar motor of varying powers and varying cardinal step sizes.

## Connect to the APT Stepper Motor Control Module in Python

To connect to an APT Stepper Motor Control Module Positional Controller using Instrumentkit, you can use the following code:

```python
import instrumentkit as ik

# Connect to the APT Stepper Motor Control Module Positional Controller
controller = ik.thorlabs.APTMotorController.open_serial("/dev/ttyUSB0", baud=115200)

# Get the first channel of the controller
channel = controller.channel[0]

# Set the motor model for the channel
channel.motor_model = "PRM1-Z8"

# Move the motor to a specific position
channel.move(1000)  # Move to position 1000 (encoder counts)

# Get the current position of the motor
position = channel.position
print(f"Current position: {position}")
```

This code connects to the APT Stepper Motor Control Module Positional Controller using the `open_serial` method, specifying the serial port and baud rate. It then gets the first channel of the controller and sets the motor model to "PRM1-Z8". Finally, it moves the motor to position 1000 and retrieves the current position of the motor.
