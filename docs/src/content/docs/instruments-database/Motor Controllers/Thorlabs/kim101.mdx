## Connect to the KIM101 in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/contribution/blocks/custom-flojoy-block/)

To connect to a KIM101 Positional Controller using Instrumentkit, you can use the following code:

```python
import instrumentkit as ik

# Connect to the KIM101 controller
controller = ik.thorlabs.APTPiezoInertiaActuator.open_serial("/dev/ttyUSB0", baud=115200)

# Get the first channel of the controller
channel = controller.channel[0]

# Enable the channel
channel.enabled_single = True

# Set the drive parameters for the channel
max_volts = ik.units.Quantity(110, ik.units.V)
step_rate = ik.units.Quantity(1000, 1/ik.units.s)
acceleration = ik.units.Quantity(10000, 1/ik.units.s**2)
channel.drive_op_parameters = [max_volts, step_rate, acceleration]

# Move the channel to a specific position
channel.move_abs(1000)
```

This code connects to the KIM101 controller using the `open_serial` method from the `ik.thorlabs.APTPiezoInertiaActuator` class. It then enables the first channel, sets the drive parameters, and moves the channel to a specific position using the `enabled_single`, `drive_op_parameters`, and `move_abs` properties and methods, respectively.
