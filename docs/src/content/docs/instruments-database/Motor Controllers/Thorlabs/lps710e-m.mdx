title: Connecting to LPS710E/M by Thorlabs in Python
description: The LPS710E(/M) Amplified Piezo Stage provides long range, fine focus Z-axis travel for a microscope slide while maintaining a compact, low-profile footprint. It features submicron repeatability, nanometer positioning resolution, low angular error, and fast millisecond response and settling times. When used with the LPSA1(/M) microscope slide holder, the stage is ideal for imaging modalities requiring sensitive sample positioning and sectioning, such as confocal laser scanning microscopy. This stage is not compatible with trans-illumination.

## Connect to the LPS710E/M in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/contribution/blocks/custom-flojoy-block/)

import SectionsCard from "@root/src/components/SectionsCard";

To connect to a LPS710E/M Positional Controller using Instrumentkit, you can use the following code:

```python
import instrumentkit as ik

# Connect to the LPS710E/M Positional Controller
controller = ik.thorlabs.LPS710EM.open_serial("/dev/ttyUSB0", baud=115200)

# Get the channel object for channel 1
channel = controller.channel[0]

# Enable the channel
channel.enabled = True

# Move the channel to a specific position
channel.move(100)  # Move to position 100 (encoder counts)

# Get the current position of the channel
position = channel.position
print(f"Current position: {position}")
```

This code connects to the LPS710E/M Positional Controller using the `open_serial` method, specifying the serial port and baud rate. It then retrieves the channel object for channel 1 and enables it. The channel is then moved to a specific position using the `move` method, and the current position is printed.
