To connect to a K10CR1 Motion using Qcodes Community, you can use the following Python script:

```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.Thorlabs import Thorlabs_K10CR1

# Connect to the Thorlabs K10CR1 instrument
k10cr1 = Thorlabs_K10CR1("k10cr1", device_id=1, apt=apt)

# Print the hardware information of the device
print(k10cr1.get_idn())

# Set the position of the rotator
k10cr1.position(90)

# Get the current position of the rotator
print(k10cr1.position())

# Set the minimum velocity of the rotator
k10cr1.velocity_min(1)

# Get the minimum velocity of the rotator
print(k10cr1.velocity_min())

# Move the rotator in the forward direction
k10cr1.move_direction(Thorlabs_K10CR1.RotationDirection.FORWARD)

# Stop the rotator
k10cr1.stop()

# Move the rotator to the home position
k10cr1.move_home()

# Enable the rotator
k10cr1.enable()

# Disable the rotator
k10cr1.disable()

# Disconnect from the instrument
k10cr1.close()
```

Note: Make sure to replace `device_id=1` with the appropriate device ID for your setup.
