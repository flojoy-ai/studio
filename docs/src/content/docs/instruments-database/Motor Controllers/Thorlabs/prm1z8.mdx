title: Connecting to PRM1Z8 by Thorlabs in Python
description: The PRM1Z8 is a small, compact, DC servo motorized 360° rotation mount and stage that accepts Ø1" optics and SM1-threaded components. The user can measure the angular displacement by using the Vernier dial in conjunction with the graduation marks that are marked on the rotating plate in 1° increments. This rotation stage/mount is also equipped with a home limit switch to facilitate automated rotation to the precise 0° position, allowing absolute angular positioning thereafter. The limit switch is designed to allow continuous rotation of the stage over multiple 360° cycles.

## Connect to the PRM1Z8 in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/contribution/blocks/custom-flojoy-block/)

To connect to a PRM1Z8 Motion using Qcodes Community, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes import Station
from qcodes_contrib_drivers.drivers.Thorlabs.PRM1Z8 import Thorlabs_PRM1Z8
from qcodes_contrib_drivers.drivers.Thorlabs.APT import Thorlabs_APT

# Create an instance of the Thorlabs APT server
apt = Thorlabs_APT()

# Connect to the PRM1Z8 polarizer wheel
prm1z8 = Thorlabs_PRM1Z8('prm1z8', device_id=1, apt=apt)

# Create a station and add the instrument
station = Station()
station.add_component(prm1z8)

# Connect to the instrument
station.connect(prm1z8)

# Now you can use the instrument
position = prm1z8.position()
print(f"Current position: {position} degrees")

# Set the position to 45 degrees
prm1z8.position(45)
```

Note that you need to have the `qcodes_contrib_drivers` package installed to use the `Thorlabs_PRM1Z8` and `Thorlabs_APT` classes.
