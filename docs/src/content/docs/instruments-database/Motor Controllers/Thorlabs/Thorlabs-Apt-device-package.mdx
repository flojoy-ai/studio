## Connect to the Thorlabs Apt device package in Python

```python
from qcodes_contrib_drivers.drivers.ERAInstruments import ERASynth

# Connect to the ERASynth signal generator
lo = ERASynth("ERASynth", 'ASRL/dev/cu.usbmodem14101::INSTR')

# Turn off the output
lo.off()

# Print updated snapshot once to make sure the snapshot will be up-to-date
# This may take a few seconds
lo.print_readable_snapshot(update=True)

# Configure the local oscillator
lo.ref_osc_source("int")  # Use internal reference
lo.frequency(4.7e9)
lo.power(10)  # Set the amplitude to 10 dBm
lo.on()  # Turn on the output
```

This script connects to the ERASynth signal generator using the specified address (`ASRL/dev/cu.usbmodem14101::INSTR`). It then turns off the RF output, prints the updated snapshot of the instrument's parameters, configures the local oscillator with the desired frequency and power, and finally turns on the RF output.

Note: Make sure to replace `'ASRL/dev/cu.usbmodem14101::INSTR'` with the actual address of your ERASynth signal generator.
