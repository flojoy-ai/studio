## Connect to the Smaract-MCS2 in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/contribution/blocks/custom-flojoy-block/)

import SectionsCard from "@root/src/components/SectionsCard";


<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Flojoy" label="Flojoy" className="flojoy-instrument-tabs">

<SectionsCard category="MOTOR_CONTROLLERS" manufacturer="Smaract"></SectionsCard>

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Instrumental" label="Instrumental">

To connect to a Smaract-MCS2 Motion using Instrumental, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from instrumental import instrument

# Get the list of available instruments
paramsets = list_instruments()

# Connect to the first instrument in the list
dev = instrument(paramsets[0])

# Perform operations on the connected device
dev.move_home()
# Check the current position of the device
pos = dev.check_position()
print("Current position:", pos)
# Close the connection to the device
dev.close()
```

This script imports the `instrument` function from the `instrumental` module and uses it to connect to the first instrument in the list returned by the `list_instruments` function. It then performs some operations on the connected device, such as moving the device to its home position and checking its current position. Finally, it closes the connection to the device using the `close` method.
