## Connect to the Keithley S46 in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/contribution/blocks/custom-flojoy-block/)

import NodeCardCollection from "@root/src/components/NodeCardCollection";

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Flojoy" label="Flojoy" className="flojoy-instrument-tabs">

To connect to a Keithley S46 Switch using Qcodes, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.Keithley.KeithleyS46 import KeithleyS46

# Create an instance of the KeithleyS46 instrument
s46 = KeithleyS46("s46", "TCPIP::192.168.1.1::INSTR")

# Open a connection to the instrument
s46.connect()

# Print the available channels
print(s46.available_channels)

# Close channel 'A1'
s46.A1.set("close")

# Check if channel 'A1' is closed
print(s46.A1.is_closed())

# Open all channels
s46.open_all_channels()

# Close channel 'R2'
s46.R2.set("close")

# Check if channel 'R2' is closed
print(s46.R2.is_closed())

# Close the connection to the instrument
s46.disconnect()
```

This script creates an instance of the `KeithleyS46` instrument, connects to it using the specified address (replace `"TCPIP::192.168.1.1::INSTR"` with the actual address of your instrument), and performs various operations on the switch channels. Finally, it disconnects from the instrument.
