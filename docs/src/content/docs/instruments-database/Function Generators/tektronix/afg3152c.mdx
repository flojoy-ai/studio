title: Connecting to AFG3152C by Tektronix in Python
description: Users can choose from 12 different standard waveforms. Arbitrary waveforms can be generated up to 128 K in length at high sampling rates. On pulse waveforms, leading and trailing edge time can be set independently. External signals can be connected and added to the output signal. Dual-channel models can generate two identical or completely different signals. All instruments feature a highly stable time base with only ±1 ppm drift per year.

Users can choose from 12 different standard waveforms. Arbitrary waveforms can be generated up to 128 K in length at high sampling rates. On pulse waveforms, leading and trailing edge time can be set independently. External signals can be connected and added to the output signal.

## Connect to the AFG3152C in Python

```python
from pymeasure.adapters import VISAAdapter
from pymeasure.instruments import AFG3152C

# Create a VISA adapter and connect to the instrument
adapter = VISAAdapter("GPIB::1")
afg = AFG3152C(adapter)

# Reset the instrument to default settings
afg.reset()

# Set the shape of channel 1 to sinusoidal
afg.ch1.shape = "sinusoidal"

# Set the unit of channel 1 to VPP
afg.ch1.unit = "VPP"

# Set the amplitude of channel 1 to 1 VPP
afg.ch1.amp_vpp = 1

# Set the frequency of channel 1 to 1 KHz
afg.ch1.frequency = 1e3

# Enable the output of channel 1
afg.ch1.enable()
```

This script connects to the AFG3152C function generator using a VISA adapter and sets the properties of channel 1 to generate a sinusoidal waveform with an amplitude of 1 VPP and a frequency of 1 KHz. Finally, it enables the output of channel 1.
