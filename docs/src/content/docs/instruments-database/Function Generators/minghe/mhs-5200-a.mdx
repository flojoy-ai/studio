## Connect to the MHS 5200 A in Python

Here is an example Python script that uses Instrumentkit to connect to a MHS 5200 A Function Generator:

```python
import instrumentkit as ik

# Connect to the MHS 5200 A Function Generator
mhs = ik.minghe.MHS5200.open_serial(vid=1027, pid=24577, baud=19200, timeout=1)

# Set the frequency of channel 1 to 1 kHz
mhs.channel[0].frequency = 1e3

# Set the amplitude of channel 1 to 2 V peak-to-peak
mhs.channel[0].amplitude = 2, ik.VoltageMode.peak_to_peak

# Enable channel 1
mhs.channel[0].enable = True

# Set the frequency of channel 2 to 2 kHz
mhs.channel[1].frequency = 2e3

# Set the amplitude of channel 2 to 1 V rms
mhs.channel[1].amplitude = 1, ik.VoltageMode.rms

# Enable channel 2
mhs.channel[1].enable = True

# Disconnect from the MHS 5200 A Function Generator
mhs.close()
```

Explanation:
1. The `import instrumentkit as ik` statement imports the Instrumentkit library and assigns it the alias `ik`.
2. The `ik.minghe.MHS5200.open_serial()` function is used to connect to the MHS 5200 A Function Generator via serial communication. The `vid`, `pid`, `baud`, and `timeout` parameters specify the vendor ID, product ID, baud rate, and timeout for the serial connection.
3. The `mhs.channel[0]` and `mhs.channel[1]` statements access the first and second channels of the MHS 5200 A Function Generator, respectively.
4. The `frequency` property is used to set the frequency of a channel. In this example, the frequency of channel 1 is set to 1 kHz and the frequency of channel 2 is set to 2 kHz.
5. The `amplitude` property is used to set the amplitude of a channel. In this example, the amplitude of channel 1 is set to 2 V peak-to-peak and the amplitude of channel 2 is set to 1 V rms.
6. The `enable` property is used to enable or disable a channel. In this example, both channel 1 and channel 2 are enabled.
7. The `mhs.close()` statement is used to disconnect from the MHS 5200 A Function Generator.
