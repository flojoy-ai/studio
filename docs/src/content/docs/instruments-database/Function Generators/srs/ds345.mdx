## Connect to the DS345 in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/contribution/blocks/custom-flojoy-block/)

To connect to a DS345 Function Generator using Instrumentkit, you can use the following Python script:

```python
import instrumentkit as ik
import instrumentkit.devices.srs as srs
import instrumentkit.units as u

# Connect to the DS345 Function Generator
srs345 = srs.SRS345.open_gpib('/dev/ttyUSB0', 1)

# Set the output frequency to 1 MHz
srs345.frequency = 1 * u.MHz

# Get the offset voltage
offset_voltage = srs345.offset

# Set the output function to triangle
srs345.function = srs345.Function.triangle
```

This script imports the necessary modules from Instrumentkit (`instrumentkit`), as well as the specific module for the SRS DS345 Function Generator (`instrumentkit.srs`). It also imports the units module (`instrumentkit.units`) for specifying the frequency and voltage units.

The script then connects to the DS345 Function Generator using the `open_gpib` method, specifying the device path (`/dev/ttyUSB0`) and the GPIB address (1).

After connecting, it sets the output frequency to 1 MHz by assigning the desired frequency to the `frequency` property of the `srs345` object.

Next, it retrieves the offset voltage by accessing the `offset` property of the `srs345` object.

Finally, it sets the output function to triangle by assigning the `srs345.Function.triangle` value to the `function` property of the `srs345` object.
