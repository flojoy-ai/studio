title: Connecting to LDA by Vaunix in Python
description: The LDA-908V-4 Digital Attenuator is a highly accurate, bidirectional, 50 Ohm step attenuator. The LDA-908V-4 provides calibrated attenuation from 1 to 8000 MHz with an amazing step size of 0.1 dB and typical accuracy <0.25 dB over 90 dB of control range. The attenuators are easily programmable for fixed attenuation, swept attenuation ramps and fading profiles directly from the included Graphical User Interface (GUI). Alternatively, for users wishing to develop their own interface, Vaunix supplies LabVIEW drivers, Windows API DLL files, Linux drivers, Python examples and much more.

## Connect to the LDA in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/contribution/blocks/custom-flojoy-block/)

import NodeCardCollection from "@root/src/components/NodeCardCollection";

Here is a Python script that uses Qcodes Community to connect to a LDA-908V-4 Digital Attenuator:

```python
from qcodes import Station
from qcodes_contrib_drivers.drivers.Vaunix_LDA import LDA

# Create a station to hold the instrument
station = Station()

# Connect to the LDA-908V-4 Digital Attenuator
lda = LDA('lda', serial_number=908, dll_path='path/to/dll')

# Add the LDA to the station
station.add_component(lda)

# Print the IDN of the LDA
print(lda.get_idn())

# Set the attenuation to 10 dB on channel 1
lda.ch1.attenuation(10)

# Close the connection to the LDA
lda.close()
```

Make sure to replace `'path/to/dll'` with the actual path to the DLL file for the LDA-908V-4 Digital Attenuator.
