title: Connecting to LDA by Vaunix in Python
description: The LDA-302P-H Lab Brick USB programmable 50 Ohm digital attenuator has an input power of up to +33 dBm, and offers frequency coverage of 10 to 3,000 MHz. It has an attenuation range of 31.5 dB and a step size of 0.5 dB. The unit is powered and controlled by USB connection to a PC or self-powered hub, and is programmable for fixed attenuation or swept attenuation ramps directly from the included graphical user interface (GUI) software.

## Connect to the LDA in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/contribution/blocks/custom-flojoy-block/)

Here is a Python script that uses Qcodes Community to connect to a LDA-302P-HN Digital Attenuator:

```python
from qcodes import Station
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.vaunix.LDA import LDA

# Create a station to hold the instrument
station = Station()

# Connect to the LDA-302P-HN Digital Attenuator
lda = LDA('lda', serial_number=302, dll_path='path/to/dll')

# Add the LDA instrument to the station
station.add_component(lda)

# Print the instrument's IDN information
print(lda.get_idn())

# Set the attenuation to 10 dB
lda.attenuation(10)

# Close the connection to the instrument
lda.close()
```

Make sure to replace `'path/to/dll'` with the actual path to the DLL file for the LDA instrument.
