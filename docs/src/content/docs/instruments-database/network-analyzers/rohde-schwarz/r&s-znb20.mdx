title: Connecting to Rohde Schwarz ZNB 20 by Rohdes&Schwarz in Python
description: The R&S ZNB20 from R&S is a mid range vector network analyzer with two or four test ports for the frequency range from 100 kHz to 20 GHz. It has a dynamic range of 135 dB which makes it possible to perform precise measurements on wideband DUTs or components whose behavior at low frequencies is especially important. The analyzer has a large 12.1 inches touch screen interface which makes it easy to control and review test results. The ports on the R&S 20 have 2.92 mm Male connectors.

## Connect to the Rohde Schwarz ZNB 20 in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/contribution/blocks/custom-flojoy-block/)

import NodeCardCollection from "@root/src/components/NodeCardCollection";

To connect to a SPD1305X Power Supply using Pymeasure, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from pymeasure.adapters import VISAAdapter
from pymeasure.instruments.siglenttechnologies import SPD1305X

# Create a VISA adapter
adapter = VISAAdapter("USB0::0xF4EC::0xEE3A::SPD13A1R3L0001::INSTR")

# Connect to the SPD1305X Power Supply
power_supply = SPD1305X(adapter)

# Perform operations on the power supply
power_supply.ch_1.voltage = 10  # Set the voltage of channel 1 to 10V
power_supply.ch_1.current_limit = 2  # Set the current limit of channel 1 to 2A

# Disconnect from the power supply
power_supply.disconnect()
```

Note: Replace the VISA address `"USB0::0xF4EC::0xEE3A::SPD13A1R3L0001::INSTR"` with the appropriate address for your specific instrument.
