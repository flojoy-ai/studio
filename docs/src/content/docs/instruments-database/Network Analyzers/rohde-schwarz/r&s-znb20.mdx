title: Connecting to R&S ZNB20 by Rohdes&Schwarz in Python
description: The R&S ZNB20 from R&S is a mid range vector network analyzer with two or four test ports for the frequency range from 100 kHz to 20 GHz. It has a dynamic range of 135 dB which makes it possible to perform precise measurements on wideband DUTs or components whose behavior at low frequencies is especially important. The analyzer has a large 12.1 inches touch screen interface which makes it easy to control and review test results. The ports on the R&S 20 have 2.92 mm Male connectors.

## Connect to the R&S ZNB20 in Python

To connect to a R&S ZNB20 Network Analyzer using Qcodes, you can use the following code:

```python
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.rohde_schwarz.ZNB.ZNB import ZNB

# Create an instance of the ZNB20 Network Analyzer
znb = ZNB('znb', 'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR')

# Connect to the instrument
znb.connect()
```

In the code above, we import the `ZNB` class from the `qcodes.instrument_drivers.rohde_schwarz.ZNB.ZNB` module. Then, we create an instance of the `ZNB` class with the desired name (`znb`) and the appropriate VISA resource string (`TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR`) for your specific instrument.

Finally, we call the `connect()` method to establish a connection to the instrument.

Note: Make sure to replace `'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR'` with the correct VISA resource string for your specific instrument.
