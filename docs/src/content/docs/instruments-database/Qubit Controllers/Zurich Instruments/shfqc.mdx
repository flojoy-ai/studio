## Connect to the SHFQC in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/contribution/blocks/custom-flojoy-block/)

import SectionsCard from "@root/src/components/SectionsCard";

To connect to a SHFQC Qubit Controller using Qcodes, you can use the following code:

```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.zhinst import SHFQC

# Connect to the SHFQC Qubit Controller
shfqc = SHFQC("shfqc", "dev1234")

# Print the available SGChannels
print(shfqc.sgchannels())

# Print the available QAChannels
print(shfqc.qachannels())

# Print the available Scopes
print(shfqc.scopes())

# Close the connection to the SHFQC Qubit Controller
shfqc.close()
```

This code imports the necessary modules and creates an instance of the `SHFQC` instrument driver. You can then use the `sgchannels()`, `qachannels()`, and `scopes()` methods to print the available SGChannels, QAChannels, and Scopes, respectively. Finally, the `close()` method is called to close the connection to the SHFQC Qubit Controller.
