## Qubit Controllers

<details> 
<summary>Category Description</summary> 
Each control channel of the SHFQC has its own powerful sequencer for creating phase- and timing-programmable waveforms, so that a single SHFQC can control or couple qubits with pulses from DC to 8.5 GHz, and react at any time on measurements from the readout channel. With the SHFQC-16W upgrade option, the readout channel's freely configurable integration weights and readout-pulse memories are doubled from 8 to 16. This provides more flexibility in configuring the readout, e.g. by enabling full real-time control and readout of 6 qutrits.
