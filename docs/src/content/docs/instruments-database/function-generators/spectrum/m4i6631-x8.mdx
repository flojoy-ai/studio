title: Connecting to M4I by Spectrum in Python
description: The M4i.66xx-x8 series arbitrary waveform generators (AWG) deliver the highest performance in both speed and resolution. The series includes PCIe cards with either one, two or four synchronous channels. The large onboard memory can be segmented to replay different waveform sequences. The AWG features a PCI Express x8 Gen 2 interface that offers outstanding data streaming performance. The interface and Spectrum’s optimized drivers enable data transfer rates in excess of 2.8 GB/s so that signals can continuously replayed at a high output rate. While the cards have been designed using the latest technology they are still software compatible with the drivers from earlier Spectrum waveform generators. So, existing customers can use the same software they developed for a 10 year old 20 MS/s AWG card and for an M4i series 625 MS/s AWG.

## Connect to the M4I in Python

```python
from instrumentkit import Scope

# Connect to the oscilloscope
scope = Scope("TCPIP::192.168.1.1::INSTR")

# Set the timebase and voltage scale
scope.timebase = 1e-3  # 1 ms/div
scope.channel1.voltage_scale = 0.1  # 0.1 V/div

# Acquire a waveform
waveform = scope.acquire_waveform(channel=1)

# Print the waveform data
print(waveform.data)

# Disconnect from the oscilloscope
scope.disconnect()
```

In this script, we first import the `Scope` class from the `instrumentkit` module. Then, we create an instance of the `Scope` class by passing the instrument's address as a string to the constructor.

Next, we set the timebase and voltage scale of the oscilloscope using the `timebase` and `voltage_scale` properties of the `Scope` and `Channel` classes, respectively.

We then acquire a waveform from channel 1 using the `acquire_waveform` method of the `Scope` class. The acquired waveform is stored in the `waveform` variable.

Finally, we print the waveform data using the `data` property of the `Waveform` class. After that, we disconnect from the oscilloscope using the `disconnect` method of the `Scope` class.

Note: Replace `"TCPIP::192.168.1.1::INSTR"` with the actual IP address or VISA resource string of your TDS224 Oscilloscope.
