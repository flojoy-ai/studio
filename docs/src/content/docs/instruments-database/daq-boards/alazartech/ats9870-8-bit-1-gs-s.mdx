## Connect to the ATS 9870 in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/contribution/blocks/custom-flojoy-block/)

import NodeCardCollection from "@root/src/components/NodeCardCollection";

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="Flojoy" label="Flojoy" className="flojoy-instrument-tabs">

To connect to an ATS9870-8 bit, 1 GS/s DAQ board using Qcodes, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.AlazarTech.ATS9870 import AlazarTechATS9870

# Create an instance of the AlazarTechATS9870 driver
daq = AlazarTechATS9870('daq', dll_path='C:\\WINDOWS\\System32\\ATSApi.dll')

# Connect to the DAQ board
daq.connect('ATS9870')

# Print the IDN information of the DAQ board
print(daq.get_idn())

# Set the sample rate to 1 GS/s
daq.sample_rate(1e9)

# Set other parameters as needed

# Disconnect from the DAQ board
daq.disconnect()
```

This script creates an instance of the `AlazarTechATS9870` driver, connects to the ATS9870-8 bit, 1 GS/s DAQ board, and sets the sample rate to 1 GS/s. You can modify the script to set other parameters or perform data acquisition as required.
