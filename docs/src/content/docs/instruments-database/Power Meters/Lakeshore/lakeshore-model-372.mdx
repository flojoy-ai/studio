The Model 372 AC resistance bridge and temperature controller builds on the solid foundation provided by the original Lake Shore AC resistance bridge. The Model 372 provides the best possible temperature measurement and control capabilities for dilution refrigerators (DRs) that are intended to be operated below 100 mK.

## Connect to the Lakeshore Model 372 in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/contribution/blocks/custom-flojoy-block/)

import SectionsCard from "@root/src/components/SectionsCard";

To connect to a Lakeshore Model 372 Temperature Controller using Qcodes, you can use the following Python script:

```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.Lakeshore.Model_372 import LakeshoreModel372

# Create an instance of the LakeshoreModel372 driver
lakeshore = LakeshoreModel372("lakeshore", "TCPIP::192.168.1.1::7777::SOCKET")

# Connect to the instrument
lakeshore.connect()

# Print the identification string of the instrument
print(lakeshore.IDN())

# Set the setpoint temperature of the sample heater to 300 K
lakeshore.sample_heater.setpoint(300)

# Close the connection to the instrument
lakeshore.disconnect()
```

In this script, we import the necessary modules and create an instance of the `LakeshoreModel372` driver. We provide the name of the instrument and the address (IP address and port number) of the instrument as arguments to the constructor.

We then connect to the instrument using the `connect()` method. After connecting, we can use the various methods and parameters provided by the driver to interact with the instrument. In this example, we print the identification string of the instrument using the `IDN()` method and set the setpoint temperature of the sample heater to 300 K using the `setpoint()` method.

Finally, we disconnect from the instrument using the `disconnect()` method.

Note: Replace `"TCPIP::192.168.1.1::7777::SOCKET"` with the actual IP address and port number of your Lakeshore Model 372 Temperature Controller.
