## Connect to the Keithley 6517A in Python

```python
from pymeasure.adapters import VISAAdapter
from pymeasure.instruments.keithley import Keithley6517B

# Create a VISA adapter for the instrument
adapter = VISAAdapter("GPIB::1")

# Connect to the Keithley 6517A Power Meter
keithley = Keithley6517B(adapter)

# Enable the source output
keithley.enable_source()

# Set the source voltage range to 200 V
keithley.source_voltage_range = 200

# Set the source voltage to 20 V
keithley.source_voltage = 20

# Set up to measure resistance
keithley.measure_resistance()

# Ramp the voltage to 50 V
keithley.ramp_to_voltage(50)

# Print the measured resistance in Ohms
print(keithley.resistance)

# Ramp the voltage to 0 V and disable the output
keithley.shutdown()

# Disconnect from the instrument
keithley.disconnect()
```

This script connects to the Keithley 6517A Power Meter using a VISA adapter and creates an instance of the `Keithley6517B` class. It then enables the source output, sets the source voltage range and voltage, and configures the instrument to measure resistance. It ramps the voltage to 50 V and prints the measured resistance. Finally, it ramps the voltage to 0 V and disables the output before disconnecting from the instrument.
