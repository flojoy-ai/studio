title: Connecting to Keithley 2182 by Keithley in Python
description: The two-channel Model 2182A Nanovoltmeter is optimized for making stable, low noise voltage measurements and for characterizing low resistance materials and devices reliably and repeatably. It provides higher measurement speed and significantly better noise performance than alternative low voltage measurement solutions. It offers a simplified delta mode for making resistance measurements in combination with a reversing current source, such as the Model 6220 or 6221.

## Connect to the Keithley 2182 in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/contribution/blocks/custom-flojoy-block/)

import SectionsCard from "@root/src/components/SectionsCard";

To connect to a Keithley 2182 Power Meter using Instrumentkit, you can use the following Python script:

```python
import instrumentkit as ik

# Connect to the Keithley 2182 Power Meter
meter = ik.keithley.Keithley2182.open_gpibusb("/dev/ttyUSB0", 10)

# Perform a measurement
measurement = meter.measure(meter.Mode.voltage_dc)

# Print the measurement value
print(measurement)
```

This script imports the `instrumentkit` module and uses the `open_gpibusb` method of the `Keithley2182` class to connect to the Keithley 2182 Power Meter. The first argument of `open_gpibusb` is the device path (`/dev/ttyUSB0` in this example) and the second argument is the GPIB address (10 in this example).

After connecting to the power meter, the script performs a measurement using the `measure` method of the `Keithley2182` class. The measurement mode is specified as `meter.Mode.voltage_dc`, which represents the DC voltage measurement mode.

Finally, the script prints the measurement value.
