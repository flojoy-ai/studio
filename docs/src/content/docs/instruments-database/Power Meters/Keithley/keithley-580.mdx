title: Connecting to Keithley 580 by Keithley in Python
description: The Keithley 580 Micro-ohmmeter combines high accuracy, resolution, and sensitivity with three special capabilities that make micro-ohm measurements easier and more versatile than ever. When measuring contact and connector resistances, it is important not to puncture oxides and films that may have formed. The Model 580 ensures this dry-circuit condition by clamping the open-circuit test voltage to 20mV on the 200m, 2, and 20 ranges when the 20mV MAX button is pressed.  The Keithley 580 can test more devices by enabling both test current polarity and waveform (DC or pulsed) to be selected. When using pulsed test current, the Model 580 automatically compensates for thermoelectric EMFs. Tests on inductive devices are best performed using DC test current, as this avoids the effects of time constants on pulsed current resistance measurements. For temperature-sensitive components, a single trigger mode of operation minimizes power delivered to the device.

## Connect to the Keithley 580 in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/contribution/blocks/custom-flojoy-block/)

To connect to a Keithley 580 Power Meter using Instrumentkit, you can use the following Python script:

```python
import instrumentkit as ik

# Connect to the Keithley 580 Power Meter
keithley = ik.keithley.Keithley580.open_gpibusb('/dev/ttyUSB0', 1)

# Set the polarity to positive
keithley.polarity = keithley.Polarity.positive

# Set the drive mode to pulsed
keithley.drive = keithley.Drive.pulsed

# Enable the dry circuit test mode
keithley.dry_circuit_test = True

# Enable the operate mode
keithley.operate = True

# Set the input range to auto
keithley.input_range = "auto"

# Perform a measurement
measurement = keithley.measure()
print(f"Resistance: {measurement}")

# Close the connection
keithley.close()
```

This script connects to the Keithley 580 Power Meter using the `open_gpibusb` method, sets various properties of the instrument such as polarity, drive mode, dry circuit test mode, operate mode, and input range, performs a measurement using the `measure` method, and then closes the connection using the `close` method. The measured resistance is printed to the console.
