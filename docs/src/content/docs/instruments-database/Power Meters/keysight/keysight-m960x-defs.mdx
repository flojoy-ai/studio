## Connect to the Keysight M960x defs in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/contribution/blocks/custom-flojoy-block/)

import SectionsCard from "@root/src/components/SectionsCard";

Here is a Python script that uses Qcodes to connect to a Keysight M960x Power Meter:

```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.Keysight.Keysight_M960x import Keysight_M960x

# Connect to the power meter
power_meter = Keysight_M960x("power_meter", "TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR")

# Print the power meter identification
print(power_meter.idn())

# Set the power meter to measure power
power_meter.measurement_function("POWER")

# Set the power meter range
power_meter.range_auto(True)

# Read the power measurement
power = power_meter.power()

# Print the power measurement
print(f"Power: {power} dBm")

# Close the connection to the power meter
power_meter.close()
```

This script connects to the power meter using the IP address "192.168.1.1" and sets up the measurement function to measure power. It then reads the power measurement and prints the result. Finally, it closes the connection to the power meter.
