# Example usage

This script creates a class `LakeShore425` that represents the LakeShore 425 Gaussmeter. It provides high-level methods for interacting with the instrument, such as setting the unit, range, and measurement mode. The `measure` method allows you to perform a measurement of a given number of points and returns the mean and standard deviation of the measured field values.

In the example usage section, a serial adapter is created to connect to the instrument. Then, an instance of the `LakeShore425` class is created using the adapter. The unit and range are set, and a measurement of 10 points is performed. The mean and standard deviation are then printed to the console.
