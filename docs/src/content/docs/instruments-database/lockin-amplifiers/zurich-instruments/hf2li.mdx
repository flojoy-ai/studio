## Connect to the HF 2 LI in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/contribution/blocks/custom-flojoy-block/)

import NodeCardCollection from "@root/src/components/NodeCardCollection";

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="Flojoy" label="Flojoy" className="flojoy-instrument-tabs">

<NodeCardCollection category='LOCKIN_AMPLIFIERS' manufacturer='ZURICH'></NodeCardCollection>

To connect to a HF2LI Lockin Amplifier using Qcodes Community, you can use the following Python script:

```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.zhinst import HF2LI

# Create an instance of the HF2LI instrument
hf2li = HF2LI('hf2li', 'dev204', demod=1, sigout=0, auxouts={'X': 0, 'Y': 3})

# Connect to the instrument
hf2li.connect()

# Now you can use the instrument to perform various operations
# For example, you can get the phase value
phase = hf2li.phase()
print(f"Phase: {phase} degrees")

# You can also set the phase value
hf2li.phase(45)

# You can get the gain for the X output
gain_x = hf2li.gain_X()
print(f"Gain for X output: {gain_x} V/Vrms")

# You can set the gain for the X output
hf2li.gain_X(0.5)

# Disconnect from the instrument
hf2li.disconnect()
```

Note: Make sure you have installed the necessary dependencies, including `qcodes` and `zhinst`.
