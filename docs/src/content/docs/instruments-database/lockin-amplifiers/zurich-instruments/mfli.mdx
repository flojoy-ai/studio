## Connect to the Mfli in Python

The provided code is a stub for connecting to a Zurich Instruments MFLI Lock-in Amplifier using Qcodes. To establish a connection and interact with the lock-in amplifier, you can use the following code:

```python
from qcodes import Station
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.zhinst import MFLI

# Create a station to hold the instruments
station = Station()

# Connect to the MFLI Lock-in Amplifier
mflilockin = MFLI("MFLI", "dev1234", interface="1GbE")

# Add the lock-in amplifier to the station
station.add_component(mflilockin)

# Print the available parameters of the lock-in amplifier
print(mflilockin.parameters)

# Perform further operations with the lock-in amplifier as needed
# ...

# Close the connection to the lock-in amplifier
mflilockin.close()
```

Make sure to replace `"dev1234"` with the actual device ID or name of your MFLI Lock-in Amplifier. The `interface` parameter specifies the connection interface, which is set to `"1GbE"` in this example.

The code creates a `Station` object to hold the instruments. Then, it establishes a connection to the MFLI Lock-in Amplifier using the `MFLI` class from the `zhinst` module of Qcodes. The lock-in amplifier is added to the station using the `add_component` method.

You can access and manipulate the lock-in amplifier's parameters using the `parameters` attribute of the `MFLI` instance. In the provided code, it prints the available parameters of the lock-in amplifier.

Finally, the connection to the lock-in amplifier is closed using the `close` method of the `MFLI` instance.

Note: This code assumes that you have already installed the `qcodes` and `zhinst-qcodes` packages.
