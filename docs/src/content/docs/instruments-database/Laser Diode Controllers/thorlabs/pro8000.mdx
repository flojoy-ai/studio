title: Connecting to PRO8000 by Thorlabs in Python
description: The PRO8000 Chassis can accept up to 8 modules and is ideally suited for the needs of large test setups. This made-to-order chassis can be custom configured with up to eight modules that best meet individual experimental needs prior to purchase. The chassis can also be ordered empty, without any pre-installed modules. The empty slots of the PRO8000 can be covered using PRO8000-C front cover plates.

The code defines a class `ThorlabsPro8000` that represents the Thorlabs Pro 8000 modular laser driver. It inherits from the `Instrument` class provided by the `pymeasure.instruments` module.

The class has several class-level variables defined:
- `SLOTS` is a range from 1 to 8, representing the available slots in the laser driver.
- `LDC_POLARITIES` is a list of allowed laser diode polarities, which can be either 'AG' or 'CG'.
- `STATUS` is a list of allowed status values, which can be either 'ON' or 'OFF'.

The `__init__` method initializes the instrument by calling the `Instrument` class's `__init__` method and passing the provided `adapter`, `name`, and any additional keyword arguments.

The class also defines several instrument controls using the `Instrument.control` decorator. These controls allow you to interact with the instrument by sending commands and receiving responses.

- `slot` is a control for selecting the slot. It uses the command `:SLOT?` to query the current slot and `:SLOT %d` to set the slot. The allowed values for the slot are specified as `SLOTS`, and the `strict_discrete_set` validator is used to ensure that only valid values are used.

- `LDCCurrent` is a control for controlling the laser current. It uses the command `:ILD:SET?` to query the current laser current and `:ILD:SET %g` to set the laser current.

- `LDCCurrentLimit` is a control for setting the software current limit. It uses the command `:LIMC:SET?` to query the current software current limit and `:LIMC:SET %g` to set the software current limit.

- `LDCPolarity` is a control for setting the laser diode polarity. It uses the command `:LIMC:SET?` to query the current laser diode polarity and `:LIMC:SET %s` to set the laser diode polarity. The allowed values for the polarity are specified as `LDC_POLARITIES`, and the `strict_discrete_set` validator is used to ensure that only valid values are used.

- `LDCStatus` is a control for setting the laser diode status. It uses the command `:LASER?` to query the current laser diode status and `:LASER %s` to set the laser diode status. The allowed values for the status are specified as `STATUS`, and the `strict_discrete_set` validator is used to ensure that only valid values are used.

- `TEDStatus` is a control for controlling the TEC status. It uses the command `:TEC?` to query the current TEC status and `:TEC %s` to set the TEC status. The allowed values for the status are specified as `STATUS`, and the `strict_discrete_set` validator is used to ensure that only valid values are used.

- `TEDSetTemperature` is a control for controlling the TEC temperature. It uses the command `:TEMP:SET?` to query the current TEC temperature and `:TEMP:SET %g` to set the TEC temperature.

These controls provide a convenient way to interact with the Thorlabs Pro 8000 modular laser driver using the PyMeasure library.
