title: Connecting to LDA-203B by Vaunix in Python
description: The LDA-203B Digital Attenuator is a bidirectional, 50 Ohm step attenuator. The LDA-203B provides 63 dB of attenuation control over the frequency range of 1 to 20 GHz with a step size of 0.5 dB. The attenuators are easily programmable for fixed attenuation, swept attenuation ramps and fading profiles directly from the included Graphical User Interface (GUI). Alternatively, for users wishing to develop their own interface, Vaunix supplies LabVIEW drivers, Windows API DLL files, Linux drivers, Python examples and much more.

## Connect to the LDA-203B in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/contribution/blocks/custom-flojoy-block/)

import SectionsCard from "@root/src/components/SectionsCard";

To connect to a LDA-203B Digital Attenuator using Qcodes Community, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes import Station
from qcodes_contrib_drivers.drivers.Vaunix_LDA import LDA

# Create a station to hold the instruments
station = Station()

# Connect to the LDA-203B Digital Attenuator
lda = LDA('lda', serial_number=203, dll_path='path/to/dll')

# Add the LDA to the station
station.add_component(lda)

# Print the IDN of the LDA
print(lda.get_idn())

# Set the attenuation to 10 dB
lda.attenuation(10)

# Close the connection to the LDA
lda.close()
```

Make sure to replace `'path/to/dll'` with the actual path to the DLL file for the LDA-203B Digital Attenuator.
