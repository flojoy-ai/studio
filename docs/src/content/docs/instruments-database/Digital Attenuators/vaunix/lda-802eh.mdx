title: Connecting to LDA-802EH by Vaunix in Python
description: The LDA-802EH Digital Attenuator is a high dynamic range, bidirectional, 50 Ohm step attenuator. The LDA-802EH provides 120 dB of attenuation control range from 200 to 8000 MHz with a step size of 0.1 dB. The attenuators are easily programmable for fixed attenuation, swept attenuation ramps and fading profiles directly from the included Graphical User Interface (GUI). Alternatively, for users wishing to develop their own interface, Vaunix supplies LabVIEW drivers, Windows API DLL files, Linux drivers, Python examples and much more.

## Connect to the LDA-802EH in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/contribution/blocks/custom-flojoy-block/)

To connect to a LDA-802EH Digital Attenuator using Qcodes Community, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes import Station
from qcodes_contrib_drivers.drivers.Vaunix_LDA import LDA

# Create a station to hold the instruments
station = Station()

# Connect to the LDA-802EH Digital Attenuator
attenuator = LDA('attenuator', serial_number=802, dll_path='path/to/dll')

# Add the attenuator to the station
station.add_component(attenuator)

# Print the IDN of the attenuator
print(attenuator.get_idn())

# Set the attenuation to 10 dB
attenuator.attenuation(10)

# Close the connection to the attenuator
attenuator.close()
```

Make sure to replace `'path/to/dll'` with the actual path to the DLL file for the LDA-802EH Digital Attenuator.
