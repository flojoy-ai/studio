title: Connecting to LDA-802-8 by Vaunix in Python
description: The LDA-802-8 Digital Attenuator is an 8-channel high dynamic range, bidirectional, 50 Ohm step attenuator. The LDA-802-8 provides 120 dB of attenuation control range from 200 to 8000 MHz with a step size of 0.1 dB. The attenuators are easily programmable for fixed attenuation, swept attenuation ramps and fading profiles directly from the included Graphical User Interface(GUI). Alternatively, for users wishing to develop their own interface, Vaunix supplies LabVIEW drivers, Windows API DLL files, Linux drivers, Python examples and much more.

To connect to a LDA-802-8 Digital Attenuator using Qcodes Community, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes import Station, initialise_or_create_database_at
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.vaunix.LDA import LDA

# Create a Qcodes station
station = Station()

# Initialise or create a Qcodes database
initialise_or_create_database_at("C:/path/to/database")

# Create an instance of the LDA instrument
lda = LDA("lda", serial_number=8028)

# Add the LDA instrument to the station
station.add_component(lda)

# Connect to the LDA instrument
lda.connect()

# Perform operations with the LDA instrument
# ...

# Disconnect from the LDA instrument
lda.disconnect()
```

Note: Replace `"C:/path/to/database"` with the actual path where you want to create or initialise the Qcodes database.
