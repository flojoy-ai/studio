title: Connecting to LDA-133 by Vaunix in Python
description: The LDA-133 Digital Attenuator is a bidirectional, 50 Ohm step attenuator. The LDA-133 provides fast attenuation changes from 10 to 13000 MHz with a step size of 0.5 dB and 63 dB of control range. The attenuators are easily programmable for fixed attenuation, swept attenuation ramps and fading profiles directly from the included Graphical User Interface (GUI). Alternatively, for users wishing to develop their own interface, Vaunix supplies LabVIEW drivers, Windows API DLL files, Linux drivers, Python examples and much more.

## Connect to the LDA-133 in Python

To connect to a LDA-133 Digital Attenuator using Qcodes Community, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes import Station
from qcodes_contrib_drivers.drivers.Vaunix_LDA import LDA

# Create a station to hold the instruments
station = Station()

# Connect to the LDA-133 Digital Attenuator
lda = LDA('lda', serial_number=133)
station.add_component(lda)

# Print the IDN of the LDA-133
print(lda.get_idn())

# Set the attenuation to 10 dB
lda.attenuation(10)

# Close the connection to the LDA-133
lda.close()
```

This script creates a `Station` object to hold the instruments. Then, it connects to the LDA-133 Digital Attenuator by creating an instance of the `LDA` class with the appropriate serial number. The LDA-133 is added to the station using the `add_component` method.

The IDN of the LDA-133 is printed using the `get_idn` method.

The attenuation of the LDA-133 is set to 10 dB using the `attenuation` parameter.

Finally, the connection to the LDA-133 is closed using the `close` method.
