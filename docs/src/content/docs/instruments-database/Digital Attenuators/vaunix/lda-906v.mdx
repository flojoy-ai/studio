title: Connecting to LDA-906V by Vaunix in Python
description: The LDA-906V Digital Attenuator is a highly accurate, bidirectional, 50 Ohm step attenuator. The LDA-906V provides calibrated attenuation from 200 to 6000 MHz with an amazing step size of 0.1 dB and typical accuracy < 0.25 dB over 90 dB of control range. The attenuators are easily programmable for fixed attenuation, swept attenuation ramps and fading profiles directly from the included Graphical User Interface (GUI). Alternatively, for users wishing to develop their own interface, Vaunix supplies LabVIEW drivers, Windows API DLL files, Linux drivers, Python examples and much more.

## Connect to the LDA-906V in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/contribution/blocks/custom-flojoy-block/)

import SectionsCard from "@root/src/components/SectionsCard";

Here is a Python script that uses Qcodes Community to connect to a LDA-906V Digital Attenuator:

```python
from qcodes import Station
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.vaunix.LDA import LDA

# Create a station to hold the instrument
station = Station()

# Connect to the LDA-906V Digital Attenuator
lda = LDA('lda', serial_number=906, dll_path='path/to/dll')

# Add the LDA instrument to the station
station.add_component(lda)

# Print the IDN of the instrument
print(lda.get_idn())

# Set the attenuation to 10 dB
lda.attenuation(10)

# Close the connection to the instrument
lda.close()
```

Make sure to replace `'path/to/dll'` with the actual path to the DLL file for the LDA-906V Digital Attenuator.
