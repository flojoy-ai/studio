title: Connecting to LDA-802Q by Vaunix in Python
description: The LDA-802Q Digital Attenuator is a 4-channel high dynamic range, bidirectional, 50 Ohm step attenuator. The LDA-802Q provides 120 dB of attenuation control range from 200 to 8000 MHz with a step size of 0.1 dB. The attenuators are easily programmable for fixed attenuation, swept attenuation ramps and fading profiles directly from the included Graphical User Interface (GUI). Alternatively, for users wishing to develop their own interface, Vaunix supplies LabVIEW drivers, Windows API DLL files, Linux drivers, Python examples and much more.

## Connect to the LDA-802Q in Python

To connect to a LDA-802Q Digital Attenuator using Qcodes Community, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes import Station
from qcodes_contrib_drivers.drivers.Vaunix_LDA import LDA

# Create a station to hold the instruments
station = Station()

# Connect to the LDA-802Q Digital Attenuator
lda = LDA('lda', serial_number=802, dll_path='path/to/dll')

# Add the LDA to the station
station.add_component(lda)

# Print the IDN of the LDA
print(lda.get_idn())

# Set the attenuation to 10 dB on channel 1
lda.ch1.attenuation(10)

# Close the connection to the LDA
lda.close()
```

Make sure to replace `'path/to/dll'` with the actual path to the DLL file for the LDA-802Q Digital Attenuator.
