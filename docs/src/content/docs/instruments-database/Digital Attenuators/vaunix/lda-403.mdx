title: Connecting to LDA-403 by Vaunix in Python
description: The LDA-403 offers both USB and Ethernet interfaces. The USB port uses a native HID interface to avoid the difficulties inherent in using older serial or IEEE-488 interfaces implemented over USB. As a result, Lab Brick users can get to work faster without having to install kernel level drivers, and Lab Brick devices can be easily used on any system that supports USB HID devices, including low-cost embedded computers using Linux or similar operating systems. The Ethernet interface is configurable for Static IP or DHCP with the ability to assign the HTTP port for extra security.   The LDA-403 Digital Attenuator is a bidirectional, 50 Ohm step attenuator. The LDA-403 provides attenuation control from 0.1 to 40 GHz with a step size of 0.5 dB.

## Connect to the LDA-403 in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/contribution/blocks/custom-flojoy-block/)

import SectionsCard from "@root/src/components/SectionsCard";

To connect to a LDA-403 Digital Attenuator using Qcodes Community, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes import Station
from qcodes_contrib_drivers.drivers.Vaunix_LDA import LDA

# Create a station to hold the instruments
station = Station()

# Connect to the LDA-403 Digital Attenuator
lda = LDA('lda', serial_number=403)

# Add the LDA to the station
station.add_component(lda)

# Print the IDN of the LDA
print(lda.get_idn())

# Set the attenuation to 10 dB
lda.attenuation(10)

# Close the connection to the LDA
lda.close()
```

Make sure you have installed the `qcodes-contrib-drivers` package before running this script. You can install it using pip:

```
pip install qcodes-contrib-drivers
```

Note: The script assumes that the DLLs required for the LDA-403 Digital Attenuator are in the default search path. If the DLLs are located in a different directory, you can specify the `dll_path` argument when creating the `LDA` object.
