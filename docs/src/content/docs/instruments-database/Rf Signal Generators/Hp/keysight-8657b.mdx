## Connect to the Keysight 8657B in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/contribution/blocks/custom-flojoy-block/)

import SectionsCard from "@root/src/components/SectionsCard";

Here is a Python script that uses Pymeasure to connect to a Keysight 8657B RF Signal Generator:

```python
from pymeasure.adapters import VISAAdapter
from pymeasure.instruments.hp import HP8657B

# Create a VISA adapter for the instrument
adapter = VISAAdapter("GPIB::7")

# Connect to the instrument
instrument = HP8657B(adapter)

# Set the output frequency to 1 MHz
instrument.frequency = 1E6

# Set the output level to -10 dBm
instrument.level = -10

# Enable the output
instrument.output_enabled = True

# Disconnect from the instrument
instrument.shutdown()
```

Explanation of the code:
1. Import the necessary modules from Pymeasure.
2. Create a `VISAAdapter` object with the appropriate address for the instrument.
3. Create an `HP8657B` object with the adapter.
4. Use the `frequency` property to set the output frequency of the instrument.
5. Use the `level` property to set the output level of the instrument.
6. Use the `output_enabled` property to enable the output of the instrument.
7. Use the `shutdown` method to disconnect from the instrument.
