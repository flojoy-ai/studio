## Connect to the Keysight 34980A in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/contribution/blocks/custom-flojoy-block/)

import NodeCardCollection from "@root/src/components/NodeCardCollection";

<TabItem value="Flojoy" label="Flojoy" className="flojoy-instrument-tabs">

Here is a Python script that uses Qcodes to connect to a Keysight 34980A DAQ board:

```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.Keysight.Keysight_34980A import Keysight34980A

# Create an instance of the instrument
daq = Keysight34980A('daq', 'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::INSTR')

# Connect to the instrument
daq.connect()

# Perform operations with the instrument
daq.reset()
status = daq.get_status()
error = daq.get_error()

# Disconnect from the instrument
daq.disconnect()
```

This script imports the necessary modules and creates an instance of the `Keysight34980A` instrument with the name 'daq' and the specified address. It then connects to the instrument using the `connect()` method.

After connecting, the script performs some operations with the instrument, such as resetting it, getting the status and error messages. Finally, it disconnects from the instrument using the `disconnect()` method.
