## Connect to the Keysight 34470A Submodules in Python

To connect to a Keysight 34470A Multimeter using Qcodes, you can use the following Python script:

```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.Keysight.Keysight_344xxA import Keysight_34470A

# Create an instance of the Keysight 34470A driver
multimeter = Keysight_34470A('multimeter', 'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::INSTR')

# Connect to the multimeter
multimeter.connect()

# Perform measurements or other operations with the multimeter

# Disconnect from the multimeter
multimeter.disconnect()
```

This script imports the necessary modules and creates an instance of the `Keysight_34470A` driver. The `Keysight_34470A` class is a subclass of `_Keysight_344xxA`, which is a submodule of the `Keysight` module in the Qcodes library.

The `Keysight_34470A` class is an alias for `Keysight34470A` and is provided for backwards compatibility.

To connect to the multimeter, you call the `connect()` method on the `multimeter` instance. You can then perform measurements or other operations with the multimeter.

Finally, you can disconnect from the multimeter by calling the `disconnect()` method on the `multimeter` instance.
