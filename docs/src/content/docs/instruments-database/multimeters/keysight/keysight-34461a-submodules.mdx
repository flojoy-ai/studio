```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.Keysight.Keysight_344xxA import Keysight34461A

# Create an instance of the Keysight34461A driver
dmm = Keysight34461A('dmm', 'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::INSTR')

# Connect to the instrument
dmm.connect()

# Perform measurements or other operations with the instrument

# Disconnect from the instrument
dmm.disconnect()
```

Explanation:
1. Import the necessary modules: `qcodes` and the `Keysight34461A` driver from `qcodes.instrument_drivers.Keysight.Keysight_344xxA`.
2. Create an instance of the `Keysight34461A` driver with a name ('dmm') and the instrument's address ('TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::INSTR').
3. Connect to the instrument using the `connect()` method.
4. Perform measurements or other operations with the instrument.
5. Disconnect from the instrument using the `disconnect()` method.
