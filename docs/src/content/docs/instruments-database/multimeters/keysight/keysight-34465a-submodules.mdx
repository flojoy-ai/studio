## Connect to the Keysight 34465A Submodules in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/contribution/blocks/custom-flojoy-block/)

import SectionsCard from "@root/src/components/SectionsCard";

To connect to a Keysight 34465A Multimeter using Qcodes, you can use the following Python script:

```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.Keysight.Keysight_344xxA import Keysight_34465A

# Create an instance of the Keysight 34465A driver
multimeter = Keysight_34465A('multimeter', 'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::INSTR')

# Connect to the multimeter
multimeter.connect()

# Perform measurements or other operations with the multimeter

# Disconnect from the multimeter
multimeter.disconnect()
```

This script imports the necessary modules and creates an instance of the `Keysight_34465A` driver, specifying a name for the instrument and the address of the multimeter. Then, it connects to the multimeter using the `connect()` method, performs any desired measurements or operations, and finally disconnects from the multimeter using the `disconnect()` method.
