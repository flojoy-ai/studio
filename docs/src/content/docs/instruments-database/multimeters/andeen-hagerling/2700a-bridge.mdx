title: Connecting to 2700A Bridge by Andeen Hagerling in Python
description: The Andeen-Hagerling AH 2700A offers unparalleled stability, resolution, linearity and accuracy in a multi-frequency capacitance/loss bridge. Its numerous state-of-the-art features make it an exceptionally user-friendly instrument, measuring capacitance and loss in medium and high impedance ranges, and thus allows using three-terminal rather than five-terminal connections to the DUT (Device Under Test).  The new AH 2700A-E offers substantially improved resolution over the entire operating range, bringing a super-sensitivity that enables it to explore applications in calibration, scientific research, and manufacturing with a new precision.  The AH2700A-E is the pinnacle of decades of Andeen-Hagerling experience in bridge design and manufacture, and is complemented by its sister model, the AH2700A-E-C that offers continuous frequency scanning.

## Connect to the 2700A Bridge in Python

To connect to a 2700A Bridge Multimeter using Pymeasure, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from pymeasure.instruments import Instrument
from pymeasure.adapters import VISAAdapter
from pymeasure.instruments.validators import strict_range
from .ah2500a import AH2500A
from .ah2700a import AH2700A

# Create a VISA adapter for communication
adapter = VISAAdapter("GPIB0::12::INSTR")

# Create an instance of the AH2700A instrument
bridge = AH2700A(adapter)

# Connect to the instrument
bridge.open()

# Perform measurements or other operations
idn = bridge.id
print("Instrument ID:", idn)

config = bridge.config
print("Configuration:", config)

frequency = bridge.frequency
print("Frequency:", frequency)

# Reset the instrument
bridge.reset()

# Trigger a new measurement
bridge.trigger()
# Close the connection to the instrument
bridge.close()
```

This script creates a VISA adapter to establish communication with the instrument. Then, it creates an instance of the `AH2700A` class, which represents the Andeen Hagerling 2700A Precision Capacitance Bridge instrument. The `open()` method is used to connect to the instrument.

After connecting, you can perform various operations on the instrument. The `id` attribute retrieves the instrument identification, the `config` attribute reads out the configuration, and the `frequency` attribute gets or sets the test frequency used for measurements.

The `reset()` method resets the instrument, and the `trigger()` method triggers a new measurement without blocking. Finally, the `close()` method is used to close the connection to the instrument.
