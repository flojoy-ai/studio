title: Connecting to PPMS Dynacool by Quantum Design in Python
description: Quantum Design's DynaCool™ PPMS® performs electrical, thermal and magnetic measurements while controlling the samples temperature and magnetic environment.The system uses a single two-stage pulse tube cooler to cool both the superconducting magnet and provide temperature control below 10K, resulting in a low vibration environment for sample measurements. At low temperatures a small amount of Helium-4 is condensed and used to cool the sample while the magnet is cooled through solid contact to a 4 K plate.

## Connect to the PPMS Dynacool in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/contribution/blocks/custom-flojoy-block/)

import SectionsCard from "@root/src/components/SectionsCard";

Here is an example Python script that uses Qcodes to connect to a PPMS DynaCool Spectrometer:

```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.QuantumDesign.DynaCoolPPMS import DynaCool

# Connect to the DynaCool instrument
dynacool = DynaCool('dynacool', 'TCPIP0::127.0.0.1::5000::SOCKET')

# Print the instrument ID
print(dynacool.get_idn())

# Set the temperature setpoint to 10 K
dynacool.temperature_setpoint(10)

# Ramp the field to 1 T in blocking mode
dynacool.field_target(1)
dynacool.ramp(mode='blocking')

# Get the measured field
field = dynacool.field_measured()
print(f"Measured field: {field} T")

# Close the connection to the instrument
dynacool.close()
```

This script connects to the DynaCool instrument using the IP address and port specified in the `address` argument of the `DynaCool` constructor. It then sets the temperature setpoint to 10 K and ramps the field to 1 T in blocking mode. Finally, it retrieves the measured field value and prints it. The connection to the instrument is closed at the end of the script using the `close()` method.
