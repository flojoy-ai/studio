## Connect to the SR 570 in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/contribution/blocks/custom-flojoy-block/)

```python
from pymeasure.adapters import VISAAdapter
from pymeasure.instruments.sr570 import SR570

# Create a VISA adapter for the instrument
adapter = VISAAdapter("GPIB0::1::INSTR")

# Connect to the SR 570 Preamplifier
preamplifier = SR570(adapter)

# Set the sensitivity to 1e-9
preamplifier.sensitivity = 1e-9

# Set the filter type to '6dB Highpass'
preamplifier.filter_type = '6dB Highpass'

# Set the lowpass frequency to 1 Hz
preamplifier.low_freq = 1

# Set the highpass frequency to 0.03 Hz
preamplifier.high_freq = 0.03

# Enable the bias voltage
preamplifier.enable_bias()

# Enable the offset current
preamplifier.enable_offset_current()

# Clear any overload condition
preamplifier.clear_overload()

# Blank the frontend output
preamplifier.blank_front()

# Disconnect from the instrument
preamplifier.disconnect()
```

This script connects to the SR 570 Preamplifier using a VISA adapter, sets various settings such as sensitivity, filter type, and frequency, enables the bias voltage and offset current, clears any overload condition, and blanks the frontend output. Finally, it disconnects from the instrument.
