## Connect to the SR560 in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/contribution/blocks/custom-flojoy-block/)

import NodeCardCollection from "@root/src/components/NodeCardCollection";

To connect to a SR560 Preamplifier using Qcodes, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes.instrument.base import Instrument
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.stanford_research.SR560 import SR560

# Create an instance of the SR560 instrument
sr560 = SR560('sr560', address='your_device_address')

# Connect to the instrument
sr560.connect()

# Print the instrument identification
print(sr560.get_idn())

# Set the cutoff frequencies
sr560.cutoff_lo('DC')
sr560.cutoff_hi(1000)

# Set the gain
sr560.gain(10)

# Set the output inversion
sr560.invert(True)

# Disconnect from the instrument
sr560.disconnect()
```

Make sure to replace `'your_device_address'` with the actual address of your SR560 Preamplifier.
