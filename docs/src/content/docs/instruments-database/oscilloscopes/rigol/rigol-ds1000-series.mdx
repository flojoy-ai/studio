title: Connecting to Rigol DS1000-Series by Rigol in Python
description: The 1000 Series from RIGOL include the B, D, and E series oscilloscopes. The E Series are the value leader with 50-100 MHz models that include 2 channels and 1 Million points of memory. The D Series add low speed digital capture enabling basic mixed signal analysis in a economic package. The B Series provide more speed and power including our economic 4 channel, 200 MHz DS1204B model which provides 2 GSa/sec sampling. With features including FFTs, record and replay, roll mode, alternate trigger mode, and adjustable trigger sensitivity the 1000 Series is a great entry for value oscilloscope requirements.

# Connect to the oscilloscope
oscilloscope = RigolDS1000Series("192.168.1.1")  # Replace with the IP address of your oscilloscope

# Set the acquisition type to normal
oscilloscope.acquire_type = RigolDS1000Series.AcquisitionType.normal

# Set the number of averages to 8
oscilloscope.acquire_averages = 8

# Trigger the oscilloscope
oscilloscope.force_trigger()

# Start running the oscilloscope trigger
oscilloscope.run()

# Stop the oscilloscope trigger
