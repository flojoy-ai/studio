## Connect to the WaveSurfer 510 in Python

To connect to a WaveSurfer 510 Oscilloscope using Instrumentkit, you can use the following code:

```python
import instrumentkit as ik

# Connect to the oscilloscope
oscilloscope = ik.teledyne.MAUI.open_visa("TCPIP0::192.168.0.10::INSTR")

# Perform operations on the oscilloscope
# For example, you can set the time division
oscilloscope.time_div = 200e-9

# You can also access and control the channels
channel = oscilloscope.channel[0]
channel.trace = True
channel.coupling = channel.Coupling.dc50
channel.scale = 1.0

# Read a waveform from the channel
xdat, ydat = channel.read_waveform()

# Perform other operations as needed

# Close the connection to the oscilloscope
oscilloscope.close()
```

This code connects to the oscilloscope at the specified IP address ("TCPIP0::192.168.0.10::INSTR") using the VISA protocol. It then performs various operations on the oscilloscope, such as setting the time division, accessing and controlling the channels, and reading a waveform from a channel. Finally, it closes the connection to the oscilloscope.
