title: Connecting to DPO5000 by Tektronix in Python
description: The MSO/DPO5000 Series offers the industry's most complete visualization of signals, providing fast insight into the real operation of your device. Tektronix proprietary FastAcq™ technology delivers a fast waveform capture – greater than 250,000 waveforms per second – that enables you to see glitches and other infrequent transients within seconds, revealing the true nature of device faults. A digital phosphor display with color intensity grading shows the history of a signal's activity by using color to identify areas of the signal that occur more frequently, providing a visual display of just how often anomalies occur.

## Connect to the DPO5000 in Python

Here is an example Python script that uses Qcodes to connect to a DPO5000 Oscilloscope:

```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.tektronix.Tektronix_DPO7000xx import TektronixDPO7000xx

# Connect to the oscilloscope
oscilloscope = TektronixDPO7000xx("oscilloscope", "TCPIP::1.2.3.4::INSTR")

# Print the available channels
print(oscilloscope.channel.names)

# Set the time per division
oscilloscope.channel1.scale(0.1)  # Set channel 1 time per division to 0.1s

# Acquire and plot a waveform
waveform = oscilloscope.channel1.waveform()
waveform.plot()

# Close the connection to the oscilloscope
oscilloscope.close()
```

This script connects to the oscilloscope using the IP address "1.2.3.4" and creates an instance of the `TektronixDPO7000xx` driver. It then prints the names of the available channels, sets the time per division for channel 1 to 0.1s, acquires a waveform from channel 1, and plots the waveform. Finally, it closes the connection to the oscilloscope.
