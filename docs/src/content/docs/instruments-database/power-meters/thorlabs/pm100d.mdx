## Connect to the PM 100 D in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/contribution/blocks/custom-flojoy-block/)

import NodeCardCollection from "@root/src/components/NodeCardCollection";

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="Flojoy" label="Flojoy" className="flojoy-instrument-tabs">

<TabItem value="Instrumental" label="Instrumental">

Here's a Python script that uses Instrumental to connect to a PM100D Power Meter:

```python
from instrumental import instrument, list_instruments

# List all available instruments
print(list_instruments())

# Connect to the PM100D Power Meter
pm100d = instrument('Thorlabs PM100D')

# Get the current power reading
power = pm100d.power()
print(f"Current power reading: {power}")

# Set the input signal wavelength to 1550 nm
pm100d.wavelength = 1550

# Get the input signal wavelength
wavelength = pm100d.wavelength
print(f"Current wavelength setting: {wavelength}")

# Make a multi-sample power measurement
measurement = pm100d.measure(n_samples=10)
print(f"Average power: {measurement.nominal_value} Â± {measurement.std_dev}")

# Close the connection to the PM100D Power Meter
pm100d.close()
```

This script first lists all available instruments using `list_instruments()` function. Then, it connects to the PM100D Power Meter using the `instrument()` function and assigns it to the `pm100d` variable.

The script then demonstrates various operations with the power meter. It retrieves the current power reading using the `power()` method, sets the input signal wavelength to 1550 nm using the `wavelength` attribute, and retrieves the current wavelength setting.

Finally, it makes a multi-sample power measurement using the `measure()` method and prints the average power and standard deviation.

The script ends by closing the connection to the power meter using the `close()` method.
