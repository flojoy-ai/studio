title: Connecting to TC200 by Thorlabs in Python
description: The TC200 Temperature Controller is a bench top controller intended for use with resistive heating elements rated up to 18 Watts. This general purpose instrument can drive various types of heaters, including foil and resistive coil types. It accepts feedback from either positive or negative temperature coefficient thermistors, has programmable P, I, and D gains, and will display the temperature in 째C, 째F, or K. In addition, it can be programmed for up to five sequential temperature settings along with associated ramp and hold times for each level. A user-programmable maximum temperature limit provides protection to the device being heated, and a user-programmable power limit protects the heating element from being over driven.

## Instrument Card

The TC200 Temperature Controller is a bench top controller intended for use with resistive heating elements
rated up to 18 Watts. This general purpose instrument can drive various types of heaters, including foil and
resistive coil types. It accepts feedback from either positive or negative temperature coefficient thermistors, has
programmable P, I, and D gains, and will display the temperature in 째C, 째F, or K. In addition, it can be
programmed for up to five sequential temperature settings along with associated ramp and hold times for each
level. A user-programmable maximum temperature limit provides protection to the device being heated, and a
user-programmable power limit protects the heating element from being over driven.

# Get the current output mode of the TC200
mode = tc200.mode
print(f"Output Mode: {mode}")

# Set the enable status to True (turn on the heater)
tc200.enable = True

# Get the current temperature of the sensor
temperature = tc200.temperature
print(f"Temperature: {temperature}")

# Get the maximum temperature setting
max_temperature = tc200.max_temperature
print(f"Max Temperature: {max_temperature}")

# Set the maximum temperature to 100 degrees Celsius
tc200.max_temperature = 100

# Get the current set temperature
temperature_set = tc200.temperature_set
print(f"Set Temperature: {temperature_set}")

# Set the temperature setpoint to 50 degrees Celsius

```

This script demonstrates how to connect to the TC200 Temperature Controller, retrieve and set various properties such as output mode, enable status, temperature, maximum temperature, temperature setpoint, PID gains, temperature units, thermistor type, beta value, and maximum power. Finally, it closes the connection to the TC200 Temperature Controller.
