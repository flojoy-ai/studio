## Connect to the XP GlassMan FJ in Python

To connect to a FJ Series Power Supply using Instrumentkit, you can use the `GlassmanFR` class from the provided code. Here's an example script:

```python
import instrumentkit as ik

# Connect to the power supply
psu = ik.glassman.GlassmanFR.open_serial('/dev/ttyUSB0', 9600)

# Set the output voltage to 100V
psu.voltage = 100

# Turn on the power supply
psu.output = True

# Read the output voltage
voltage = psu.voltage
print(voltage)
```

This script first imports the `instrumentkit` module as `ik`. Then, it creates an instance of the `GlassmanFR` class by calling the `open_serial` method and passing the serial port name and baud rate as arguments.

Next, it sets the output voltage of the power supply to 100V by assigning the desired voltage value to the `voltage` property of the `psu` object.

After that, it turns on the power supply by assigning `True` to the `output` property of the `psu` object.

Finally, it reads the output voltage by accessing the `voltage` property of the `psu` object and prints the result.

Note that you may need to modify the serial port name and baud rate to match your specific setup.
