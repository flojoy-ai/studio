title: Connecting to Keithley 2602 B by Keithley in Python
description: The 2602B from Keithley is a 2600B series dual channel system SourceMeter® (SMU) instrument (3A DC, 10A pulse). It is an industry’s leading current/voltage source and measure solutions. This dual channel model combines the capabilities of a precision power supply, true current source, 6 1/2 digit DMM, arbitrary waveform generator, pulse generator and electronic load all into one tightly integrated instrument. The result is a powerful solution that significantly boosts productivity in applications ranging from bench-top I-V characterization through highly automated production test. It has 100mV to 40V voltage, 100nA to 10A current measurement range (source). This is tightly integrated, 4-quadrant voltage/current source and measure instrument which offers best in class performance with 6 1/2digit resolution. Built-in web browser based software enables remote control through any browser, on any computer, from anywhere in the world.

## Connect to the Keithley 2602 B in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/contribution/blocks/custom-flojoy-block/)

To connect to a Keithley 2602B Power Supply using Qcodes, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.tektronix.Keithley_2600 import Keithley2602B

# Create an instance of the Keithley2602B instrument
keithley = Keithley2602B('keithley', 'TCPIP::192.168.1.1::INSTR')

# Connect to the instrument
keithley.connect()

# Perform operations with the instrument

# Disconnect from the instrument
keithley.disconnect()
```

In this script, we import the `Keithley2602B` class from the `qcodes.instrument_drivers.tektronix.Keithley_2600` module. We then create an instance of the `Keithley2602B` instrument, providing a name for the instrument ('keithley') and the connection string ('TCPIP::192.168.1.1::INSTR').

Next, we connect to the instrument using the `connect()` method. You can perform various operations with the instrument, such as setting voltage or current, measuring voltage or current, etc.

Finally, we disconnect from the instrument using the `disconnect()` method.
