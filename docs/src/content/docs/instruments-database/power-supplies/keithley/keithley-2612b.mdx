title: Connecting to Keithley 2612 B by Keithley in Python
description: The 2612B from Keithley is a 2600B series dual channel system SourceMeter® (SMU) instrument (0.1fA, 10A pulse). It is an industry’s leading current/voltage source and measure solutions. This dual channel model combines the capabilities of a precision power supply, true current source, 6 1/2 digit DMM, arbitrary waveform generator, pulse generator and electronic load all into one tightly integrated instrument. The result is a powerful solution that significantly boosts productivity in applications ranging from bench-top I-V characterization through highly automated production test. It has 100mV to 40V voltage, 100nA to 10A current measurement range (source). This is tightly integrated, 4-quadrant voltage/current source and measure instrument which offers best in class performance with 6 1/2digit resolution. Built-in web browser based software enables remote control through any browser, on any computer, from anywhere in the world.

## Connect to the Keithley 2612 B in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/contribution/blocks/custom-flojoy-block/)

import NodeCardCollection from "@root/src/components/NodeCardCollection";

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="Flojoy" label="Flojoy" className="flojoy-instrument-tabs">

<NodeCardCollection category='POWER_SUPPLIES' manufacturer='KEITHLEY'></NodeCardCollection>

To connect to a Keithley 2612B Power Supply using Qcodes, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.tektronix.Keithley_2600 import Keithley2600
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.tektronix.Keithley_2612B import Keithley2612B

# Create an instance of the Keithley2612B driver
keithley = Keithley2612B('keithley', 'TCPIP::1.2.3.4::INSTR')

# Connect to the instrument
keithley.connect()

# Now you can use the Keithley2612B instrument for various operations
# For example, you can set the voltage and current limits
keithley.voltage_limit(10)  # Set the voltage limit to 10 V
keithley.current_limit(0.1)  # Set the current limit to 0.1 A

# You can also perform measurements
voltage = keithley.voltage()  # Measure the voltage
current = keithley.current()  # Measure the current

# Disconnect from the instrument
keithley.disconnect()
```

Note that you need to replace `'TCPIP::1.2.3.4::INSTR'` with the actual address of your Keithley 2612B Power Supply.
