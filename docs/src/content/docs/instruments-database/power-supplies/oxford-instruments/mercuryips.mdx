title: Connecting to Mercuryips Visa by Oxford Instruments in Python
description: Based on ±60 A modules with ±10 V compliance. Can be configured in parallel, series and matrix modes from the basic ±60 A with ±10 V output up to ±600 A with ±10 V or ±300 A with ±20 V output configurations. Communications support a full range of interface options (Ethernet, USB, RS232, and optional GPIB) with downloadable Mercury function library for LabVIEW. Quench protection and auto-rundown. The MercuryiPS can be programmed to run the magnet down safely in the event of magnet temperature rise, low cryogen levels or if triggered by an external TTL signal. The MercuryiPS has an on-board temperature sensor for diagnostic monitoring of the magnet temperature.

## Connect to the Mercuryips Visa in Python

```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.QuTech.MercuryiPS import MercuryiPS

# Connect to the MercuryiPS Power Supply
mercury_ips = MercuryiPS('mercury_ips', 'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR')

# Print the IDN of the Power Supply
print(mercury_ips.IDN())

# Set the output voltage to 5V
mercury_ips.voltage(5)

# Set the output current limit to 1A
mercury_ips.current_limit(1)

# Enable the output
mercury_ips.output('on')

# Disable the output after 5 seconds
qc.sleep(5)
mercury_ips.output('off')

# Close the connection to the Power Supply
mercury_ips.close()
```

In this script, we first import the necessary modules: `qcodes` and the `MercuryiPS` driver from the `QuTech` package.

Then, we create an instance of the `MercuryiPS` driver, passing the instrument name and the connection string as arguments. The connection string specifies the communication protocol and the IP address of the Power Supply.

We can then use the various methods provided by the `MercuryiPS` driver to interact with the Power Supply. In this example, we print the IDN of the Power Supply, set the output voltage to 5V, set the output current limit to 1A, enable the output, wait for 5 seconds, and then disable the output.

Finally, we close the connection to the Power Supply using the `close()` method.

Note: Make sure to replace `'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR'` with the actual IP address of your MercuryiPS Power Supply.
