## Connect to the HMP 4030 in Python

To connect to a Rohde & Schwarz HMP4030 Power Supply using Qcodes Community, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.rohde_schwarz.HMP4030 import RohdeSchwarzHMP4030

# Create an instance of the HMP4030 driver
hmp = RohdeSchwarzHMP4030('hmp', 'TCPIP0::192.168.0.1::INSTR')

# Connect to the instrument
hmp.connect()

# Now you can use the instrument for various operations
# For example, you can set the output voltage
hmp.voltage(5)  # Set the output voltage to 5V

# You can also read the current output voltage
voltage = hmp.voltage()
print(f"Output voltage: {voltage}V")

# Disconnect from the instrument
hmp.disconnect()
```

In this script, we import the `RohdeSchwarzHMP4030` class from the `qcodes.instrument_drivers.rohde_schwarz.HMP4030` module. We then create an instance of the driver by providing a name for the instrument (`'hmp'`) and the instrument's address (`'TCPIP0::192.168.0.1::INSTR'`).

Next, we connect to the instrument using the `connect()` method. After connecting, we can perform various operations on the instrument. In this example, we set the output voltage to 5V using the `voltage()` method and then read the current output voltage using the same method.

Finally, we disconnect from the instrument using the `disconnect()` method.
