title: Connecting to HMC 8042 by Rohdes&Schwarz in Python
description: the two-channel HMC8042 delivers a maximum of 5 A. The HMC804x family offers a wide range of logging functions, an integrated energy meter and electronic fuses that can be individually combined for each channel, making it ideal for hardware developers, labs and industrial environments. Linear switching power supplies ensure high efficiency, for minimum heat dissipation even at full load. Developers and industrial users benefit from useful functions such as sequenced start of channels, EasyArb and EasyRamp functions that are directly programmable on the device, an analog input for external control of voltage values, an external trigger input for controlling channels and arb steps, and adjustable overvoltage/overpower protection for each channel.

## Connect to the HMC 8042 in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/contribution/blocks/custom-flojoy-block/)

import NodeCardCollection from "@root/src/components/NodeCardCollection";

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="Flojoy" label="Flojoy" className="flojoy-instrument-tabs">

To connect to a Rohde & Schwarz HMC8042 Power Supply using Qcodes Community, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.rohde_schwarz.HMC8042 import RohdeSchwarzHMC8042

# Create an instance of the RohdeSchwarzHMC8042 driver
power_supply = RohdeSchwarzHMC8042('power_supply', 'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::INSTR')

# Connect to the power supply
power_supply.connect()

# Now you can use the power_supply object to control the power supply
# For example, you can set the voltage of channel 1 to 5V:
power_supply.ch1.voltage.set(5)

# Disconnect from the power supply
power_supply.disconnect()
```

Note that you need to replace `'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::INSTR'` with the actual IP address or VISA resource string of your power supply.
