The benefits are apparent in every signal you produce, from the sine wave frequency accuracy to the fast rise/fall times of square waves, to the ramp linearity.

## Connect to the Keysight 33250A in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/contribution/blocks/custom-flojoy-block/)

To connect to a Keysight 33250A RF Signal Generator using Qcodes, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.Keysight.Keysight_33XXX import WaveformGenerator_33XXX

# Create an instance of the instrument
signal_generator = WaveformGenerator_33XXX('signal_generator', 'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::INSTR')

# Connect to the instrument
signal_generator.connect_message()
```

This script imports the `WaveformGenerator_33XXX` class from the `qcodes.instrument_drivers.Keysight.Keysight_33XXX` module. It then creates an instance of the instrument with the name "signal_generator" and the appropriate VISA address for your specific instrument. Finally, it calls the `connect_message()` method to establish a connection to the instrument and print a connection message.
