## Connect to the Keysight 33522B in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/contribution/blocks/custom-flojoy-block/)

import SectionsCard from "@root/src/components/SectionsCard";


<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Flojoy" label="Flojoy" className="flojoy-instrument-tabs">

<SectionsCard category="RF_SIGNAL_GENERATORS" manufacturer="Keysight"></SectionsCard>

<TabItem value="QCodes" label="QCodes">

To connect to a Keysight 33522B RF Signal Generator using Qcodes, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.Keysight.Keysight_33XXX import WaveformGenerator_33XXX

# Create an instance of the instrument
signal_generator = WaveformGenerator_33XXX('signal_generator', 'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::INSTR')

# Connect to the instrument
signal_generator.connect_message()

# Now you can use the instrument to control the signal generator
# For example, to set the frequency of channel 1 to 1 MHz:
signal_generator.ch1.frequency(1e6)

# To turn on the output of channel 1:
signal_generator.ch1.output('ON')

# To turn off the output of channel 1:
signal_generator.ch1.output('OFF')

# To disconnect from the instrument
signal_generator.close()
```

Note: Replace `'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::INSTR'` with the actual VISA resource name or address of your Keysight 33522B RF Signal Generator.
