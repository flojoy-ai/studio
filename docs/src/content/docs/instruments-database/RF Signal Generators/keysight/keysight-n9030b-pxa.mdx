title: Connecting to Keysight N9030B PXA by Keysight in Python
description: PXA signal analyzers are ideally suited for high-performance research and development (R&D) applications in aerospace/defense and commercial wireless communications. The PXA analyzes signals over wider bandwidths, reduces measurement uncertainty, and reveals previously hidden signals with noise floor extension (NFE). Unravel complex signals through the PXA’s broad set of measurement applications and demodulation capabilities or add real-time spectrum analysis capabilities with an upgradeable option.

## Connect to the Keysight N9030B PXA in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/contribution/blocks/custom-flojoy-block/)

import SectionsCard from "@root/src/components/SectionsCard";

Here's an example Python script that uses Qcodes to connect to a Keysight N9030B PXA RF Signal Generator:

```python
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.Keysight.KeysightN9030B import KeysightN9030B

# Connect to the instrument
instrument = KeysightN9030B("instrument_name", "TCPIP0::xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx::inst0::INSTR")

# Print the available modes
print(instrument.mode())

# Set the mode to Spectrum Analyzer
instrument.mode("SA")

# Set the start and stop frequencies
instrument.sa.start(1e9)
instrument.sa.stop(10e9)

# Set the number of points for the sweep
instrument.sa.npts(1001)

# Enable continuous measurement
instrument.cont_meas(True)

# Perform a measurement
instrument.sa.trace()

# Disconnect from the instrument
instrument.close()
```

Note: Replace `"instrument_name"` with the desired name for your instrument and `"TCPIP0::xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx::inst0::INSTR"` with the actual IP address or VISA resource string of your instrument.
