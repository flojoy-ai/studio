title: Connecting to NI PXIe-5654 by National Instruments in Python
description: PXIe, 250 kHz to 20 GHz, PXI RF Analog Signal Generator—The PXIe-5654 features a combination of exceptional phase noise and frequency tuning time. These features address applications such as blocker test/receiver desensitization, high-performance intermodulation distortion measurements, and various electronic warfare applications. The PXIe-5654 is designed to meet the challenging requirements of RFIC characterization, satellite test, and radar applications. Some PXIe-5654 options include a PXIe-5696 Amplitude Extender Module. The PXIe-5696 supports a frequency range of 250 kHz to 20 GHz and an extended amplitude range up to 27 dBm.

To connect to a NI PXIe-5654 RF Signal Generator using Qcodes Community, you can use the following Python script:

```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes_contrib_drivers.drivers.NationalInstruments.NI_PXIe_5654 import NI_PXIe_5654

# Create an instance of the instrument
signal_generator = NI_PXIe_5654('signal_generator', 'PXI1Slot2')

# Connect to the instrument
signal_generator.connect()

# Perform operations with the instrument
frequency = 1e6  # Set the frequency to 1 MHz
signal_generator.frequency(frequency)

power_level = 0  # Set the power level to 0 dBm
signal_generator.power_level(power_level)

# Disconnect from the instrument
signal_generator.disconnect()
```

Make sure you have installed the `qcodes_contrib_drivers` package, which contains the `NI_PXIe_5654` driver. You can install it using `pip install qcodes_contrib_drivers`.

Replace `'PXI1Slot2'` with the appropriate resource name for your specific setup.

Note that this script assumes you have already set up the necessary hardware and drivers for the NI PXIe-5654 RF Signal Generator.
