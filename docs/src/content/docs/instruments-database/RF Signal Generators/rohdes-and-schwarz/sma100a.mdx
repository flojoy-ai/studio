This Class Handles Rohdes And Schwarz Sma Signal Generators. Supported Model Is: -Sma100A. Signal quality, speed and flexibility these are the criteria by which signal generators are measured today. The R&S SMA100A perfectly meets these criteria, and thus is a premium-class analog generator that sets standards due to its outstanding characteristics.

Here is a Python script that uses Pytango to connect to a SMA100A RF Signal Generator:

```python
import time
import numpy as np
import PyTango as pt

def my_transfer_handler(args):
    total_size = args.total_size if args.total_size is not None else "unknown"
    print(f"Context: '{args.context}{'with opc' if args.opc_sync else ''}', "
          f"chunk {args.chunk_ix}, "
          f"transferred {args.transferred_size} bytes, "
          f"total size {total_size}, "
          f"direction {'reading' if args.reading else 'writing'}, "
          f"data '{args.data}'")
    if args.end_of_transfer:
        print('End of Transfer')
    time.sleep(0.1)

# Connect to the SMA100A RF Signal Generator
smab = pt.DeviceProxy('sma100a/inst1')

# Reset the instrument
smab.Reset()

pc_file = r'c:\temp\bigFile.bin'
instr_file = '/var/user/bigFileInstr.bin'
pc_file_back = r'c:\temp\bigFileBack.bin'

# Generate a random file of 20MB size
x1mb = 1024 * 1024
with open(pc_file, 'wb') as file:
    for x in range(20):
        file.write(np.random.bytes(x1mb))

# Send the file to the instrument with events
smab.events.on_write_handler = my_transfer_handler
smab.utilities.data_chunk_size = x1mb
print(f'Sending file to the instrument...')
smab.utilities.send_file_from_pc_to_instrument(pc_file, instr_file)
smab.events.on_write_handler = None
print(f'Receiving file from the instrument...')
smab.events.on_read_handler = my_transfer_handler
smab.utilities.read_file_from_instrument_to_pc(instr_file, pc_file_back)
smab.events.on_read_handler = None

# Close the connection to the instrument
smab = None
```

Please note that you need to have PyTango installed in order to run this script.
