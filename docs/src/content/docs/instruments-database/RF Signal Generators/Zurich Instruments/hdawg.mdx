## Connect to the HDAWG in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/contribution/blocks/custom-flojoy-block/)

To connect to a HDAWG RF Signal Generator using Qcodes Community, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes import Station, Instrument
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.zhinst import ZIHDAWG8

# Create a station to hold the instrument
station = Station()

# Connect to the HDAWG RF Signal Generator
hdawg = ZIHDAWG8('hdawg', 'dev1234')

# Add the instrument to the station
station.add_component(hdawg)

# Now you can use the instrument to perform operations
hdawg.enable_channel(1)
hdawg.start_awg(1)

# Disconnect from the instrument
hdawg.close()
```

In this script, we first import the necessary modules and classes from Qcodes. Then, we create a `Station` object to hold the instrument. Next, we create an instance of the `ZIHDAWG8` class, passing the name of the instrument ('hdawg') and the device ID ('dev1234') as arguments. We add the instrument to the station using the `add_component` method. Finally, we can use the instrument to perform operations such as enabling a channel and starting the AWG.
Note: Replace `'dev1234'` with the actual device ID of your HDAWG RF Signal Generator.
