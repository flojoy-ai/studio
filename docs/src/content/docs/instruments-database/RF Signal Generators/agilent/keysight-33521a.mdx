## Connect to the Keysight 33521A in Python

```python
from pymeasure.adapters import VISAAdapter
from pymeasure.instruments import Agilent33500

# Create a VISA adapter for the instrument
adapter = VISAAdapter("GPIB::1")

# Connect to the instrument
instrument = Agilent33500(adapter)

# Set the output waveform shape to sine
instrument.shape = "SIN"

# Set the frequency to 1 kHz
instrument.frequency = 1e3

# Set the amplitude to 1 Vpp
instrument.amplitude = 1

# Enable the output
instrument.output = True

# Disconnect from the instrument
instrument.disconnect()
```

This script connects to the instrument using a VISA adapter and creates an instance of the `Agilent33500` class. It then sets the output waveform shape to sine, frequency to 1 kHz, amplitude to 1 Vpp, and enables the output. Finally, it disconnects from the instrument.

Note: Make sure to replace `"GPIB::1"` with the appropriate address of your Keysight 33521A RF Signal Generator.
