title: Connecting to AWG70000A by Tektronix in Python
description: The industry-leading AWG70000A Series arbitrary waveform generator (AWG) provides you with unparalleled performance at the cutting edge for sample rate, signal fidelity, and waveform memory. In order to engineer the world's most complex data communications systems, the ability to create ideal, distorted and "real life" signals is essential. The AWG70000A Series of AWGs delivers this, giving you the industry's best signal stimulus solution for ever-increasing measurement challenges. With up to 50 GS/s and 10-bit vertical resolution, it offers easy generation of very complex signals and complete control over signal characteristics

## Connect to the AWG70000A in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/contribution/blocks/custom-flojoy-block/)

import SectionsCard from "@root/src/components/SectionsCard";

To connect to a AWG70000A RF Signal Generator using Qcodes, you can use the following code:

```python
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.tektronix.AWG70000A import AWG70000A

# Create an instance of the AWG70000A instrument
awg = AWG70000A('awg', 'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR')

# Connect to the instrument
awg.connect()

# Now you can use the instrument to perform various operations
# For example, you can set the sample rate
awg.sample_rate(1e9)

# You can also set the amplitude of a channel
awg.channels.ch1.awg_amplitude(0.5)

# Play the waveform on the channel
awg.channels.ch1.play()

# Disconnect from the instrument
awg.disconnect()
```

Note that you need to replace `'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR'` with the actual VISA resource name or IP address of your AWG70000A instrument.
