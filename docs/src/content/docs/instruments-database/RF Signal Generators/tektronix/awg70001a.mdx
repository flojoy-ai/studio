title: Connecting to AWG70001A by Tektronix in Python
description: The AWG70001A, with Option AC, provides you with an additional high output amplitude connector. Option AC adds a single-ended AC coupled Planar Crown connector to the front panel of the single channel AWG70001A Arbitrary Waveform Generator. User controls are added to allow switching the output path between the standard Direct output connectors or the AC output connector. When switched to the AC path, additional user controlled amplification and attenuation is added to the signal path.

## Connect to the AWG70001A in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/contribution/blocks/custom-flojoy-block/)

To connect to a AWG70001A RF Signal Generator using Qcodes, you can use the following code:

```python
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.tektronix.AWG70000A import AWG70000A

# Create an instance of the AWG70000A instrument
awg = AWG70000A('awg', 'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR')

# Connect to the instrument
awg.connect()

# Now you can use the instrument to perform various operations
# For example, you can set the amplitude of channel 1 to 0.5 V
awg.ch1.awg_amplitude(0.5)

# You can also play the waveform on channel 1
awg.ch1.play()

# When you are done, remember to disconnect from the instrument
awg.disconnect()
```

Note that you need to replace `'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR'` with the actual VISA resource name of your AWG70001A RF Signal Generator.
