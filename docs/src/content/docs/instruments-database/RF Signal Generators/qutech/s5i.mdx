title: Connecting to S5i by Qutech in Python
description: The S5i module is a RF source ranging from 40 MHz to 4 GHz, initially designed for reflectometry. The output power of the fundamental frequency ranges from -20 dBm to 14 dBm and can be controlled by both the front panel and via software. The RF output can be muted by an external source, which gives an on/off ratio of larger than 60 dB.

## Connect to the S5i in Python

To connect to an S5i RF Signal Generator using Qcodes Community, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes.instrument.base import Instrument
from qcodes.utils.validators import Bool, Numbers
from spirack import S5i_module

class S5i(Instrument):
    # ... (same code as provided in the question)

# Create an instance of the SPI_rack class from the spirack package
spi_rack = SPI_rack()

# Create an instance of the S5i RF Signal Generator
s5i = S5i('s5i', spi_rack, module=1)

# Connect to the S5i RF Signal Generator
s5i.connect()

# Now you can use the S5i RF Signal Generator
# For example, you can enable the RF output
s5i.output_enabled(True)

# Set the frequency to 50 MHz
s5i.frequency(50e6)

# Set the output power to -10 dBm
s5i.power(-10)

# Disconnect from the S5i RF Signal Generator
s5i.disconnect()
```

Note: In the above code, make sure to replace `SPI_rack()` with the appropriate initialization code for your specific SPI rack.
