title: Connecting to R&S SGS100A by Rohdes&Schwarz in Python
description: The R&S®SGS100A is an RF source designed to meet the requirements of automated test systems. It is available as a CW source or as a vector signal generator with an integrated I/Q modulator. With its frequency range of up to 12.75 GHz, the vector signal generation version covers the essential digital signals. The CW version can be used as a flexible local oscillator and for interference testing against mobile radio standards.

## Connect to the R&S SGS100A in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/contribution/blocks/custom-flojoy-block/)

Here is a Python script that uses Qcodes to connect to a R&S SGS100A RF Signal Generator:

```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.rohde_schwarz.SGS100A import RohdeSchwarzSGS100A

# Create an instance of the instrument
sg = RohdeSchwarzSGS100A('sg', 'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR')

# Connect to the instrument
sg.connect()

# Print the frequency of the signal generator
print(sg.frequency())

# Set the frequency to 1 GHz
sg.frequency(1e9)

# Turn on the RF output
sg.on()

# Turn off the RF output
sg.off()

# Disconnect from the instrument
sg.disconnect()
```

Note: Replace `'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR'` with the actual address of your signal generator.
