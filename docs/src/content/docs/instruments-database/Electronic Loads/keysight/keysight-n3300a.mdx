## Connect to the Keysight N3300A in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/contribution/blocks/custom-flojoy-block/)

import SectionsCard from "@root/src/components/SectionsCard";

To connect to a Keysight N3300A Electronic Load using Qcodes Community, you can use the following code:

```python
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.Keysight.Keysight_N3300A import Keysight_N3300A

# Create an instance of the instrument
load = Keysight_N3300A('load', 'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR')

# Connect to the instrument
load.connect()

# Now you can use the instrument to perform operations
# For example, you can set the load current
load.current.set(1)  # Set the load current to 1 Ampere

# Disconnect from the instrument
load.disconnect()
```

Note: Replace `'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR'` with the actual VISA address of your Keysight N3300A Electronic Load.
