title: Connecting to Standa 10MWA168 by Standa in Python
description: Motorized Variable Two Wheels Attenuators 10MWA168 consists of two filter wheels. Each wheel contains eight filter mounts of ØD mm with clear aperture of Ød mm. Each mount is inclined by 4 degrees to prevent mutual reflections between filters. We supply the attenuator 10MWA168-20 with a standard, most popular, set of filters. See the table below. Alternatively, optics could be manufactured to individual orders. Or we could supply the attenuator without filters, which you can fit by yourself. 10MWA168-1 model comes WITHOUT filters. You bring a filter of each wheel into the optical path easily by hand or using automation. A single step motor drives the two wheels. A computer can operate the filter attenuator via a controller. Controllers are sold separately. For fastening, the attenuator has clearance slots for M6 and M4 screws. There are also two M6 holes, and one M4 hole (opposite to one of the M6 holes). Material, black anodized aluminium.

## Connect to the Standa 10MWA168 in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/contribution/blocks/custom-flojoy-block/)

To connect to a Standa 10MWA168 Lockin Amplifier using Qcodes Community, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes import Station, Instrument
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.standa.standa_10mwa168 import Standa_10MWA168

# Create a station to hold the instrument
station = Station()

# Create an instance of the Standa_10MWA168 instrument
standa = Standa_10MWA168('standa', serial_number='your_serial_number')

# Add the instrument to the station
station.add_component(standa)

# Connect to the instrument
standa.connect()

# Now you can use the instrument's parameters and methods
# For example, to get the current position:
position = standa.position.get()
print(f"Current position: {position}")

# To set the transmittance:
standa.transmittance.set(2)  # Set transmittance to 0.9

# Disconnect from the instrument
standa.disconnect()
```

Note: Replace `'your_serial_number'` with the actual serial number of your Standa 10MWA168 Lockin Amplifier.
