Welcome to the Flojoy Docs!

Flojoy is a test & measurement app for the modern era. Here, you can find information on how to install, use, and customize Flojoy.

Flojoy is made of two parts: *`Studio`* and *`Blocks`*. Studio is the main interface that you see (the app). Blocks are what Flojoy runs, and what Flojoy apps are made up of. For example, you would use the `SINE` block to create a sine wave.

Therefore, the docs are split into two main sections: Studio and Blocks. There is also an advanced third section for contributing to Flojoy.
